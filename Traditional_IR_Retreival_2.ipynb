Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a multifactorial, non-mendelian disorder in which rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase RET contribute to risk in combination with mutations at other genes. We have used family-based association studies to identify a disease interval, and integrated this with comparative and functional genomic analysis to prioritize conserved and functional elements within which mutations can be sought. We now show that a common non-coding RET variant within a conserved enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 is significantly associated with HSCR susceptibility and makes a 20-fold greater contribution to risk than rare alleles do. This mutation reduces in vitro enhancer activity markedly, has low penetrance, has different genetic effects in males and females, and explains several features of the complex inheritance pattern of HSCR. Thus, common low-penetrance variants, identified by association studies, can underlie both common and rare diseases.'},\n",

Midtrimester prenatal diagnosis of this disorder in this infant was attempted utilizing amniotic fluid disaccharidase analyses, ultrasound, and amniography. Decreased disaccharidase activities in amniotic fluid have been reported previously in association with other forms of intestinal obstruction. At 15 weeks' gestation, normal amniotic fluid disaccharidase levels were obtained. Serial ultrasound evaluations did not indicate any pathology, and the results from amniography were inconclusive. The implication of the normal disaccharidase values is that Hirschsprung disease may in some cases result from degeneration of intestinal ganglia after 16 weeks' gestation rather than from faulty migration of neural crest cells. The inheritance of Hirschsprung disease is generally consistent with sex-modified multifactorial inheritance with a lower threshold of expression in males. The case we report has a family history of three affected first- and second-degree relatives. Autosomal dominance with variable expressivity is a possible explanation in this family.\"},\n",

In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and their parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold susceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European ancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within the intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. With in vitro assays, we now show that the T variant disrupts a SOX10 binding site within MCS+9.7 that compromises RET transactivation. The T allele, with a control frequency of 20%-30%/47% and case frequency of 54%-62%/88% in European/Chinese-ancestry individuals, is involved in all forms of HSCR. It is marginally associated with proband gender (p = 0.13) and significantly so with length of aganglionosis (p = 7.6 x 10(-5)) and familiality (p = 6.2 x 10(-4)). The enhancer variant is more frequent in the common forms of male, short-segment, and simplex families whereas multiple, rare, coding mutations are the norm in the less common and more severe forms of female, long-segment, and multiplex families. The T variant also increases penetrance in patients with rare RET coding mutations. Thus, both rare and common mutations, individually and together, make contributions to the risk of HSCR. The distribution of RET variants in diverse HSCR patients suggests a \"cellular-recessive\" genetic model where both RET alleles\\' function is compromised. The RET allelic series, and its genotype-phenotype correlations, shows that success in variant identification in complex disorders may strongly depend on which patients are studied.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a fairly frequent cause of intestinal obstruction in children. It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations. A number of other autosomal recessive syndromes include the Shah-Waardenburg, the Bardet-Biedl and Cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndromes and other syndromes related to cholesterol and fat metabolism among others. The genetics of Hirschsprung's disease are highly complex with the majority of known genetic sites relating to the main susceptibility pathways (RET an EDNRB). Non-syndromic non-familial, short-segment HSCR appears to represent a non-Mendelian condition with variable expression and sex-dependent penetrance. Syndromic and familial forms, on the other hand, have complex patterns of inheritance and being reported as autosomal dominant, recessive and polygenic patterns of inheritance. The phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance observed in Hirschsprung's disease could also be explained by the involvement of modifier genes, especially in its syndromic forms. In this review, we look at the chromosomal and Mendelian associations and their underlying signalling pathways, to obtain a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in developing aganglionosis of the distal bowel.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a common congenital malformation leading to bowel obstruction, with an incidence of 1/5,000 live births. It is characterized by the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. As enteric neurons are derived from the vagal neural crest, HSCR is regarded as a neurocristopathy. On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder. Accordingly, segregation analysis suggested an incompletely penetrant dominant inheritance in HSCR families with aganglionosis extending beyond the sigmoid colon. We and others have mapped a dominant gene for HSCR to chromosome 10q11.2 and have ascribed the disease to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. However, the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, the low penetrance and the sex-dependent effect of RET mutations supported the existence of one or more modifier gene(s) in familial HSCR. In addition, thus far, RET mutations only accounted for 50% and 15-20% of familial and sporadic HSCR patients, respectively. RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand was unknown. Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET. Moreover, Gdnf-/- knockout mutant mice display congenital intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis, a phenotype very similar to the Ret-/- mouse. These data prompted us to hypothesize that mutations of the gene encoding GDNF could either cause or modulate the HSCR phenotype in some cases.'},\n",

RET mutational screening was performed by dHPLC and direct sequencing for the identification of RVs. In addition Taqman technology was applied for the genotyping of 3 RET CVs previously associated to HSCR, including a variant lying in an enhancer domain within RET intron 1 (rs2435357). Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS v.17.0 to analyze the distribution of the variants. Our results confirm the strongest association to HSCR for the \"enhancer\" variant, and demonstrate a significantly higher impact of it in male versus female patients. Integration of the RET RVs and CVs analysis showed that in 91.66% of cases with both kinds of mutational events, the enhancer allele is in trans with the allele bearing the RET RV. A gender effect exists on both the transmission and distribution of rare coding and common HSCR causing mutations.

In close follow-up, bowel function and satisfaction with operation results were evaluated. The median age at the time of J-Pouch reconstruction was 16 months, and covering ileostomies were closed four months later. There were no postoperative problems.

Elevated levels of extracellular vesicles have been demonstrated in patients with peripheral arterial disease and implicated in the development of atherosclerosis within peripheral vascular beds.

       "   'abstract': \"Alopecia is the most common multifactorial hair loss disorder, affecting almost 50% of the population and even having a serious psychological impact on the patients. miR-218 has therapeutic potential for alopecia since it can activate the Wnt/β-catenin channel by down-regulating SFRP2, which is a key channel in hair follicle cycle transformation for hair regrowth. Although miR-218 has the potential to treat this disease, several barrier properties of the skin challenge miRNA's delivery to the target location, such as passing through the corneum and resistant enzymatic degradation. To address these challenges, we evaluated a device that combined the use of hyaluronic acid (HA)-based dissolving microneedle (MN) to enhance corneum permeability with the lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs) as a miRNA delivery carrier to protect miR-218 from degradation. The MN patches could promote LPNs/miR-218 diffusing in the dermis region, and significantly increase the bioavailability of miR-218. Furthermore, in the shaved mouse model, the MN patches showed higher efficacy in promoting hair growth than the topical smear treatment, while avoiding the safety concern. This work established a novel and effective combination device with MN and LPNs that can be used for localized transdermal miRNA delivery to promote hair regrowth.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Multistate survival models (MSMs) are widely used in the medical field of clinical studies. For example, in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), these models can be applied to describe progression in T2D by predefining several T2D states based on available biometric measurements such as hemoglobin A1 C (HbA1c). In most cases, MSMs come with an assumption that the examination process is independent of disease progression. However, in practice, complete independence between disease progression and examination processes is unrealistic, as the frequency at which a patient accesses healthcare may vary based on treatment and/or control of the health condition. We built a joint model of a 4-state transition process of T2D with informative examination scheme (i.e., the patterns of examination times are not random). Risk factors including age, sex, race, and socioeconomic disadvantage were included in a log-linear model examining T2D transition intensities and healthcare visit frequencies. Parameters of the joint model are estimated under the framework of likelihood function by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The joint model demonstrated that people living in neighborhoods with greater socioeconomic disadvantage had a lower healthcare visit frequency under all 4 defined T2D statuses. Evaluation of race/ethnicity revealed that comparing to non-Hispanic White patients, Black patients had higher risk for progressing from Normal to Prediabetes, T2D, and Uncontrolled T2D states. Our joint model offers a framework for analyzing multistate survival processes while accounting for the dependence between disease progression and examination frequency. Unlike traditional MSMs that estimate only transition intensities, our model captures variations in healthcare visit frequencies across different disease states, providing a more comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics and healthcare access patterns.'},\n",

The occurrence of amyloid complications in patients with ADHD is infrequent. In this report, we present a case of ADHD with intestinal ulcers as the initial gastrointestinal manifestation, and subsequent pathological examination revealed the presence of amyloid deposits in the colonic mucosa. A male patient, aged 20, exhibited recurring abdominal distension and intestinal obstruction for a duration of three years. Multiple colonoscopies revealed the presence of recurrent colonic ulcers, with pathological examination indicating the existence of amyloid deposits within the mucosal layer of the colon. Abdominal CT scans suggested colonic dilatation. Following a multidisciplinary consultation, a subtotal resection of the colon was performed, and subsequent postoperative pathology confirmed a decrease and absence of myenteric plexus ganglion cells. Considering the patient's symptoms and the findings from the postoperative pathology, a diagnosis of ADHD was made. The patient's symptoms resolved postoperatively and he was discharged from the hospital and followed up for 1 year in stable condition. Our study highlights the potential association between ADHD and the initial presentation of recurrent colonic ulcers, accompanied by amyloid deposition in the intestinal mucosa.

Due to its complex and multifactorial etiology, a wide variety of therapeutic interventions have been developed. Despite constant advancements in the field, effective treatments that ameliorate the severity of Alzheimer's symptoms or cease their progression are still insufficient. Mounting evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction could be an essential component of AD pathogenesis as synapse signaling is impaired in the aging brain, which contributes to synaptic decline. Therefore, improving neuroplasticity such as synaptic plasticity or neurogenesis could be a promising therapeutic approach for alleviating the effects of AD.

Uterine horns from the four groups were subjected to histology, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses to evaluate their morphology, collagen deposition, autophagy and steroidogenesis. Oxidative-/methylglyoxal (MG)-dependent damage was investigated along with the effects on the mitochondria, SIRT1, SOD2, RAGE and GLO1 proteins. (3) Results: The PCOS uterus suffers from tissue and oxidative alterations associated with MG-AGE accumulation. LC-ALC administration alleviated PCOS uterine tissue alterations and molecular damage. The presence of PLC prevented fibrosis and maintained mitochondria content. (4) Conclusions: The present results provide evidence for oxidative and glycative damage as the main factors contributing to PCOS uterine alterations and include the uterus in the spectrum of action of carnitines on the PCOS phenotype.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'This study investigated the prevalence of bowel dysfunction and associated factors after pull-through surgery. The medical records of children under 18 years old diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease (HD) based on histopathology between 2004 and 2022 were reviewed. Bowel dysfunction after pull-through surgery was categorized into Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC), constipation, and fecal incontinence. Among 97 children diagnosed with HD, the median age at presentation was 3 (2-15) days (84.54% male). The clinical manifestations included abdominal distension (58.76%), constipation (17.52%), bilious vomiting (17.52%), nonbilious vomiting (14.43%), and enterocolitis (12.37%). HDs were classified by the location of aganglionosis: short segments (74.23%), long segments (8.25%), total colonic (12.37%), and small intestinal (5.15%). Excluding surgical complications, the prevalence of bowel dysfunction was 64.95% during an average follow-up of 8.33 years. HAEC was the most common issue (46.39%), followed by nonretentive incontinence (22.68%), constipation (20.62%), and retentive incontinence (15.46%). Preoperative HAEC was significantly associated with post-surgery HAEC (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 18.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-257.73;  The prevalence of bowel dysfunction in children with HD remains high despite successful surgical correction. Preoperative HAEC, Duhamel operation, and pull-through surgery before the age of 6 months were found to be independent factors associated with bowel dysfunction after pull-through surgery.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by extremely different phenotypes, sometimes including reduced bone mass. The underlying cause of bone impairment in these patients remains poorly understood, especially in children. Previous studies in mice and single reports in NF1 patients with osteomalacia have shown elevated serum FGF23 levels. The aim of this study was to explore for the first time these results in NF1 pediatric patients to eventually provide biological insight into bone involvement in NF1. This is an observational, cross-sectional, single-centre study evaluating FGF23/αKlotho levels, as well as other markers of bone metabolism and densitometric parameters in 31 children affected by NF1 and comparing them to 21 age- and sex-matched controls. We enrolled 31 patients with NF1(M/F 13/18; 11.7\\u2009±\\u20092.9\\xa0years). After correction for bone age, BMAD Z-score was\\u2009<\\u2009-2SDS in 5/31 patients (16.1%). No difference was found between FGF23 and αKlotho between NF1 patients and controls. No association was found between auxological, biochemical, genetic and radiological parameters and FGF23 values. In conclusion, this represents the first study assessing FGF23 levels in NF1 children and its possible relationship with decreased bone mineral density. Contrarily to previous observations, no significant differences were found between NF1 patients and controls regarding FGF23 and αKlotho levels. Additionally, there was no clear association between FGF23 and bone involvement, thus suggesting that this phenomenon is not FGF23-driven or FGF23 derangements might occur later in life. Further research is needed to understand the multifactorial mechanisms and determine optimal intervention strategies.'},\n",

Obesity is currently a worldwide epidemic and public health burden that increases the risk for developing insulin resistance and several chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The multifactorial causes of obesity include several genetic, dietary and lifestyle variables that together result in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Dietary approaches to limit fat intake are commonly prescribed to achieve the hypocaloric conditions necessary for weight loss. But dietary fat restriction is often accompanied by increased carbohydrate intake, which can dramatically increase endogenous fatty acid synthesis depending upon carbohydrate composition. Since both dietary and endogenously synthesized fatty acids contribute to the whole-body fatty acid pool, obesity can therefore result from excessive fat or carbohydrate consumption.'},\n",

However, the procedure is relatively so new that it makes assessment of the functional outcome and stooling patterns difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the transanal 1-stage endorectal pull-through operation in the management of rectosigmoid HD. Fifty-eight children (39 boys and 19 girls) aged 12 months to 13 years (mean, 2 years) who underwent transanal 1-stage endorectal pull-through operation for HD were followed up from 6 to 24 months. Clinical outcome was assessed by interviews and questionnaires. All patients had an aganglionic segment confined to the rectosigmoid area which was confirmed by the preoperative barium enema and postoperative pathological examination. Forty-six patients had satisfactory results without complications. In all the children, the mean stool times were 1 to 2 per day; only 4 had mean stool times of 8 to 10 per day. Postoperative soiling was present in 9, constipation in 5, and HD-associated enterocolitis in 3. There were no incontinence, cuff infection, anastomotic leak, and mortality in any of the patients. In the 12 symptomatic patients, there were 4 children with length of aganglionic segment less than 30 cm, and 8 had 30 cm or more. In the 46 asymptomatic patients, 42 had length of aganglionic segment less than 30 cm, and 4 had 30 cm or more. There was a significant difference between the group with less than 30 cm and the group with 30 cm or more of aganglionic segment. For statistical analysis, the Fisher exact test showed P < .05. The transanal 1-stage endorectal pull-through is a feasible and safe procedure in children with rectosigmoid HD. The clinical outcome is satisfactory. A gradual recovery could be noted in the stooling patterns along with the time after surgery. The younger the patient operated on and the shorter the aganglionic segment, the lower do the stooling disorders occur and the faster does the stooling function recover.'},\n",

The Nordic European Countries Acne Skincare Algorithm (NECASA) recommends integrating skincare and nonprescription acne treatment into acne regimens, addressing the relative lack of standardized guidance on their use as mono or adjunctives to acne treatment. The algorithm uses stratification by acne subtype and discusses management approaches per type of acne (comedonal, papulopustular, and nodulocystic acne), severity (mild to moderate and severe), and maintenance treatment. Skincare monotherapy may reduce acne lesions and maintain clearance in patients with mild acne. Adjunctive skincare may enhance the efficacy and improve tolerability of acne treatment, reduce pigmentary alterations, and improve skin barrier function. The NECASA algorithm may serve as a roadmap for integrating skincare in managing acne patients and tailoring acne treatment to improve adherence and tolerance to treatment and patient outcomes.

In plasma, higher CFHR5 levels are associated with increased thrombin generation potential and recombinant CFHR5 enhanced platelet activation in vitro. GWAS analysis of ~52,000 participants identifies six loci associated with CFHR5 plasma levels, but Mendelian randomization do not demonstrate causality between CFHR5 and VTE. Our results indicate an important role for the regulation of the alternative pathway of complement activation in VTE and that CFHR5 represents a potential diagnostic and/or risk predictive plasma biomarker.'},\n",

Although the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) is widely used to predict postoperative cardiovascular complications, its predictive accuracy is suboptimal. Considering genetic influences may improve risk prediction. The authors propose integrating polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with the RCRI to enhance MINS prediction. Identification of PRS associated with MINS could provide pathophysiological insights.

It is the outcome of a multifactorial effect involving several cells, which can be brought on by different stress reactions.The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum occurs when cells are stressed due to environmental changes, where physical or chemical stimuli induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, thereby activating the unfolded protein response (UPR), a homeostasis response designed to re-establish protein balance. Ferroptosis is a planned death of lipid peroxidation and anomalies in metabolism that is dependent on iron. Large concentrations of iron ions accumulate there, along with high concentrations of lipid peroxides and reactive oxygen species, all of which can contribute to the development of several diseases. Through the production of growth factors, adhesion factors, and inflammatory factors that trigger the start of angiogenesis, both UPR and Ferroptosis can be implicated in angiogenesis.To set the stage for further research on angiogenesis, this work concentrated on the effects of Ferroptosis and UPR on angiogenesis, respectively.'},\n",

A subgroup analysis of only patients biopsied at institutions with positive biopsy rates 1 standard deviation above or below the mean positive biopsy rate (deemed high and low outliers) was performed to better delineate these populations. A total of 7225 children underwent rectal biopsies between 2009 and 2018 at 52 Children's Hospital Association Hospitals.

The study period was from the establishment of the database to March 2022. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata V.15.0. We screened 522 records, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of cognitive frailty among older adults in China was 15%(95%CI (0.13%,0.17%)). The prevalence of cognitive frailty was higher in hospitals and nursing homes than in communities. Moreover, the prevalence of cognitive frailty was higher in women than in men. Furthermore, the prevalence rates of cognitive frailty in North China Hospital, older adults aged≥80 years, and illiterate individuals were 25%, 29%, and 55%, respectively. In conclusion, in China, the prevalence of cognitive frailty is higher among older adults, is higher in women than in men, is higher in hospitals and nursing homes than in communities, and is higher in North China than other regions. Moreover, the higher the educational level, the lower the prevalence of cognitive frailty. Multimodal interventions for cognitive frailty, including increased exercise, nutritional support, increased socialisation opportunities and multifactorial strategies, may be effective in preventing cognitive frailty.

We identify that the prevalence of RAS may lie between 2 and 5%. In defining RAS, we advocate three or more recurrences of aphthous ulcers per year as criterion for RAS. Investigation should include basic hematological (complete blood count) and nutritional (serum vitamin B12, and iron studies) parameters. Primary aim of treatment is to reduce the pain, accelerate ulcer healing, reduce the recurrences and improve the quality of life.

A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was employed in this study, utilizing the inverse-variance weighted method as the primary research method. This MR analysis analyzed data of 3022 colorectal cancer cases and 174,006 controls from the FinnGen database. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with unhealthy lifestyle factors were selected as instrumental variables (IVs), including two obesity-related indicators, BMI (body mass index) and WHR (waist-to-hip ratio). Four phenotypes of smoking (smoking initiation, ever smoked, smoking per day, smoking cessation) and one phenotype of alcohol consumption (drinks per week). Four phenotypes of physical activity (accelerometer-based physical activity, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, vigorous physical activity, strenuous sports or other exercises). All SNPs were obtained from published genome-wide association studies.

Yet, only 14 Mendelian disorders have been associated with hexamer variants. This is likely an under-ascertainment as hexamers are not well defined and not routinely examined in molecular analysis. To facilitate the interrogation of putatively pathogenic hexamer variants, we set out to define functionally important hexamers genome-wide as a resource for research and clinical testing interrogation. We identified predominant polyA sites (herein referred to as pPAS) and putative predominant hexamers across protein coding genes (PAS usage >50% per gene). As a measure of the validity of these sites, the population constraint of 4532 predominant hexamers were measured. The predominant hexamers had fewer observed variants compared to non-predominant hexamers and trimer controls, and CADD scores for variants in these hexamers were significantly higher than controls. Exome data for 1477 individuals were interrogated for hexamer variants and transcriptome data were generated for 76 individuals with 65 variants in predominant hexamers. 3' RNA-seq data showed these variants resulted in alternate polyadenylation events (38%) and in elongated mRNA transcripts (12%). Our list of pPAS and predominant hexamers are available in the UCSC genome browser and on GitHub. We suggest this list of predominant hexamers can be used to interrogate exome and genome data. Variants in these predominant hexamers should be considered candidates for pathogenic variation in human disease, and to that end we suggest pathogenicity criteria for classifying hexamer variants.\"},\n",

In brain-joint axis, the neuroendocrine regulation, circadian rhythms, and leptin signaling influence joint tissues. We also discussed the role of prostaglandin E2 in skeletal interoception and its potential as a therapeutic target. The gut-joint axis is underscored by the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders, both of which are implicated in OA pathogenesis. Furthermore, age-related sarcopenia, characterized by muscle mass and strength loss, is identified as a significant risk factor. Sarcopenia may contribute to OA progression through compromised mechanical support, systemic inflammation, and muscle-derived myokines. Finally, we synthesize the evidence supporting the modulation of circadian rhythm, skeletal interoception, gut microbiome, and muscle mass as innovative strategies for OA management.

These perceptions are influenced by the child's oral health, the child's and mother's use of healthcare, and the healthcare organization. Dental fear seems to be another proximal factor. However, family social background seems to be an enabling moderator for dental visits. The scoping review allowed us to develop a model that explains dental visits for children aged 0-5 years as a multifactorial process influenced by caregivers' perceptions of the child's oral health, the family's quality of life, and the child's dental anxiety.\"},\n",

However, large phenotypic heterogeneity hampers early detection of 22q11.2DS individuals at highest risk. Here, we investigated whether individuals with 22q11.2DS can be subdivided into clinically relevant subgroups based on their severity of cognitive impairments and whether such subgroups differ in polygenic risk. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined the number of lifetime psychiatric diagnoses and polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in an unselected nationwide biobank cohort of individuals with 22q11.2DS (n\\xa0=\\xa0183). Approximately 35% of this sample, aged 10-30 years, had a history with one or more psychiatric diagnosis. In a representative nested subgroup of 28 children and youth, we performed additional comprehensive cognitive evaluation and assessed psychiatric symptoms. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to divide the subgroup of 22q11.2DS individuals, based on their performance on the cognitive testing battery. This produced two groups that did not differ in mean age or gender composition, but were characterized by low cognitive (LF) and high cognitive (HF) functional levels. The LF group, which had significantly lower global cognitive functioning scores, also displayed higher negative symptom scores; whereas, the HF group displayed lower rate of current psychiatric disorders than the LF group and the reminder of the biobank cohort. The polygenic risk score for schizophrenia was insignificantly lower for the low functioning group than for the high functioning group, after adjustment. Cognitive functioning may provide useful information on psychiatric risk.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial changes in the delivery of healthcare and medical education. Little is known about how the pandemic has altered medical students' perceptions in regard to career choice. Methods The authors developed and implemented a multi-center survey that evaluated medical students' preferred career choice before and during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the influence of pandemic-related factors on that choice. The survey was distributed to all levels of medical students (MS) at nine medical schools across the country from November 2020 to January 2021 and represented a convenience sample. Preferred career choice was assessed through the use of a Likert scale and additional factors affecting career choice were solicited.\\xa0The degree of interest before and during the pandemic, as well as factors influencing the shift, were treated as ordinal variables and compared using chi-squared testing. Cohen's Kappa statistic was calculated to assess the degree of shifts of interest in Emergency Medicine among students. The study was deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board at the host institution, Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, and all participating sites. Results A total of 1431 of 6710 (21.3%) eligible students completed the survey. The COVID pandemic was cited as a reason for a changed interest in specialty by 193 (13.5%) students.\\xa0The most common reason for specialty change was the students' clinical experience, followed by a desire to be on the front lines, and personal/family health concerns. There was a significant association between career change and degree of interest among students interested in emergency medicine (EM) as their future specialty before the COVID pandemic as well as during the COVID pandemic. Living with an immunocompromised individual had a significant association with a reduced\\xa0interest in EM. There was a significant association between EM rotation completion and how interested students were in EM as their future specialty before the COVID pandemic and during the COVID pandemic. Among EM-interested students whose specialty interest was changed by the COVID pandemic, 34 (41.5%) became less favorable to EM, 28 (34.2%) stayed the same, and 20 (24.4%) students became more favorable to EM. Conclusions The impact of COVID-19 on medical students' career choice is a complicated matter that involves both personal and professional factors. It appears that there is a trend towards less interest in the field of EM with multifactorial influences, some of which are related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Spontaneous abortion is a pregnancy complication characterized by complex and multifactorial etiology. About 5% of childbearing women are globally affected by early pregnancy loss (EPL) and most of them experience recurrence (RPL). Epigenetic mechanisms and controlled inflammation are crucial for pregnancy maintenance and genetic predispositions may increase the risk affecting the maternal-fetal crosstalk. Combined analyses of global methylation, inflammation and inherited predispositions may contribute to define pregnancy loss etiopathogenesis. LINE-1 epigenetic regulation plays crucial roles during embryo implantation, and its hypomethylation has been associated with senescence and several complex diseases. By analysing a group of 230 women who have gone through pregnancy interruption and comparing those experiencing spontaneous EPL (n\\u2009=\\u2009123; RPL, 54.5%) with a group of normal pregnant who underwent to voluntary interruption (VPI, n\\u2009=\\u2009107), the single statistical analysis revealed significant lower (P\\u2009<\\u20090.00001) LINE-1 methylation and higher (P\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) mean cytokine levels (CKs: IL6, IL10, IL17A, IL23) in EPL. Genotyping of the following SNPs accounted for different EPL/RPL risk odds ratio: F13A1 rs5985 (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.24; 0.06-0.90); F13B rs6003 (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.23; 0.047-1.1); FGA rs6050 (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.58; 0.33-1.0); CRP rs2808635/rs876538 (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.15; 0.014-0.81); ABO rs657152 (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.48; 0.22-1.08); TP53 rs1042522 (OR\\u2009=\\u20090.54; 0.32-0.92); MTHFR rs1801133/rs1801131 (OR\\u2009=\\u20092.03; 1.2-3.47) and FGB rs1800790 (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.97; 1.01-3.87), although Bonferroni correction did not reach significant outputs.

       "   'abstract': 'Lobar pneumonia with mucus plugging (LPMP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) is a severe form of community-acquired pneumonia in children, often leading to prolonged disease courses and complications. Identifying clinical factors associated with delayed radiographic resolution and determining the optimal timing for bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) intervention are crucial for improving clinical outcomes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 151 children aged 2-14 years diagnosed with LPMP between November 2023 and July 2024. Patients were divided into two groups based on radiographic resolution at one month: common resolution (n\\u2009=\\u200983) and delayed resolution (n\\u2009=\\u200968). Clinical data, laboratory results, and timing of BAL intervention were compared between groups. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent risk factors of delayed resolution, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed predictive performance. Children in the delayed resolution group had significantly longer fever durations before intervention (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), higher C-reactive protein levels (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) compared to the common resolution group. Multivariate analysis identified elevated D-dimer levels (P\\u2009=\\u20090.010), delayed BAL intervention (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and prolonged hospital stay (P\\u2009=\\u20090.044) as independent risk factors of delayed resolution. ROC analysis showed that BAL intervention within 6 days had excellent predictive accuracy. Early BAL intervention was associated with shorter hospital stays (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), faster cough resolution (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), lower incidence of atelectasis at one month (P\\u2009=\\u20090.024), and higher rates of lung consolidation absorption (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Elevated D-dimer levels, delayed BAL intervention, and prolonged hospital stay are significant associated with delayed radiographic resolution in children with LPMP. Early BAL intervention within 6 days of admission improves clinical outcomes by accelerating recovery and reducing complications. These findings support prompt BAL as a key component in the management of pediatric LPMP.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, affecting nearly 2\\u2009million people worldwide. The etiology of MS is multifactorial: Approximately 30% of the MS risk is genetic, which implies that the remaining ~70% is environmental, with a number of factors proposed. One recently implicated risk factor for MS is the composition of the gut microbiome. Numerous case-control studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition of people with MS (pwMS) compared with healthy control individuals, and more recent studies in animal models have begun to identify the causative microbes and underlying mechanisms. Here, we review some of these mechanisms, with a specific focus on the role of host genetic variation, dietary inputs, and gut microbial metabolism, with a particular emphasis on short-chain fatty acid and tryptophan metabolism. We put forward a model where, in an individual genetically susceptible to MS, the gut microbiota and diet can synergize as potent environmental modifiers of disease risk and possibly progression, with diet-dependent gut microbial metabolites serving as a key mechanism. We also propose that specific microbial taxa may have divergent effects in individuals carrying distinct variants of MS risk alleles or other polymorphisms, as a consequence of host gene-by-gut microbiota interactions. Finally, we also propose that the effects of specific microbial taxa, especially those that exert their effects through metabolites, are highly dependent on the host dietary intake. What emerges is a complex multifaceted interaction that has been challenging to disentangle in human studies, contributing to the divergence of findings across heterogeneous cohorts with differing geography, dietary preferences, and genetics. Nonetheless, this provides a complex and individualized, yet tractable, model of how the gut microbiota regulate susceptibility to MS, and potentially progression of this disease. Thus, we conclude that prophylactic or therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiome to prevent or treat MS will require a careful and personalized consideration of host genetics, baseline gut microbiota composition, and dietary inputs.'},\n",

We included 15,790 (including 2,045 in-hospital deaths) VLBW infants born between 2013 and 2020 who were enrolled in the Korean Neonatal Network, a nationwide registry. In total, 53 prenatal and postnatal variables were sequentially added into the three discrete models stratified by hospital days: (1) within 24 h (TL-1d), (2) from day 2 to day 7 after birth (TL-7d), (3) from day 8 after birth to discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (TL-dc). Each model predicted the mortality of VLBW infants within the affected period. Multilayer perception (MLP)-based network analysis was used for modeling, and ensemble analysis with traditional machine learning (ML) analysis was additionally applied. The performance of models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values. The Shapley method was applied to reveal the contribution of each variable. Overall, the in-hospital mortality was 13.0% (1.2% in TL-1d, 4.1% in TL-7d, and 7.7% in TL-dc). Our MLP-based mortality prediction model combined with ML ensemble analysis had AUROC values of 0.932 (TL-1d), 0.973 (TL-7d), and 0.950 (TL-dc), respectively, outperforming traditional ML analysis in each timeline. Birth weight and gestational age were constant and significant risk factors, whereas the impact of the other variables varied. The findings of the study suggest that our MLP-based models could be applied in predicting in-hospital mortality for high-risk VLBW infants.

Overall, 91 patients had full-thickness tears without retraction, 131 had partial-thickness tears, and 169 had no tears. The prevalence of SS atrophy was associated with patient age and was more prevalent in women (67.6%), full-thickness tears (91.1%), an AP tear size of >15 mm (92.6%), and GH joint arthritis (100%) ( This study identified significant associations between SS atrophy and older age, female sex, full-thickness tear without retraction, an AP tear size of >15 mm, and hook-shaped acromion. Notably, partial-thickness tears were not significantly associated with SS atrophy.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Sporadic or late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease with aging the most known risk factor. Non-human primates (NHPs) may serve as an excellent model to study LOAD because of their close similarity to humans in many aspects including neuroanatomy and neurodevelopment. Recent studies reveal AD-like pathology in old NHPs. In this pilot study, we took advantage of brain samples from 6 Cynomolgus macaques that were divided into two groups: middle aged (average age 14.81 years) and older (average age 19.33 years). We investigated whether AD-like brain pathologies are present in the NHPs. We used immunohistochemical method to examine brain Aβ pathology and neuron density. We applied biochemical assays to measure tau phosphorylation and multiple signaling pathways indicated in AD. We performed electron microscopy experiments to study alterations of postsynaptic density and mitochondrial morphology in the brain of NHPs. We found multiple AD-like pathological alteration in the prefrontal cortex (but not in the hippocampus) of the older NHPs including tau hyperphosphorylation, increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), decreased expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), impairments in mitochondrial morphology, and postsynaptic densities formation. These findings may provide insights into the factors contributing to the development of LOAD, particularly during the early stage transitioning from middle to old age. Future endeavors are warranted to elucidate mechanisms underlying the regional (and perhaps cellular) vulnerability with aging and the functional correlation of such pathological changes in NHPs.\"},\n",

Germline RET proto-oncogene missense mutations have been clearly linked to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2A, MEN2B). We investigated a cohort of MEN2-related patients referred to Tygerberg Hospital, W Cape (2003-2009). The study cohort was divided into three groups based on pathology (viz. MEN/MTC, phaeochromocytoma, and a miscellaneous group of MEN pathologies). Families with identified high-risk factors were recalled. Serum calcitonin levels were monitored where indicated. DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products screened for RET gene variations by heteroduplex single-strand duplication techniques (heteroduplex single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis) being validated with automated sequencing techniques showing conformational variants in acrylamide gel. We screened 40 persons, male/female ratio 1:1.5. Three ethnic groups were represented (white (12), black (11) and mixed race (17)). Nine were index MTC cases, 5 phaeochromocytoma, 3 Hirschsprung's disease-MEN associations and 2 miscellaneous (1 neuroblastoma, 1 intestinal neuronal dysplasia), while 1 fell into the MEN2B category. The remaining 19 were unaffected relatives screened for carrier status, among whom afamilial recurrence was observed in 7. On genetic testing, an RET point mutation at the high-risk 634 cysteine allele was identified in 11 cases. A further cysteine radical mutation at the 620 position was related to MEN2 in 3 families plus 1 other family referred from elsewhere. Other less-recognised gene variations were detected throughout the RET gene in 70% of cases and included the 691 position on codon 11 (11 cases); the 432 position (4 cases, 1 homozygous) intronic mutations on exon 4 (1 case); and an IVS19-37G/C and a D1017N variation in exon 19 in 2 MEN families. Fifteen MTC patients have had thyroidectomies, of which 2 were prophylactic (C-cell hyperplasia; early occult MTC). A further 3 are awaiting prophylactic surgery. RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa. Prophylactic surgery may prevent MTC, so genetic screening is important to identify and treat high-risk patients.\"},\n",

In this study, we have developed a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting the B7 family-related molecule BTN2A2. The human BTN2A2 protein, which was highly expressed in some tumor tissues and activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), can inhibit T cell activation and proliferation. The anti-BTN2A2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) can neutralize the inhibitory effect of BTN2A2 on T cells. In mouse models of pancreatic cancer and glioma, compared to the control group, the anti-BTN2A2 treatment group exhibited tumor shrinkage of 35.8 % (P < 0.05) and 51.2 % (P < 0.01), respectively, along with increased CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) by 1.7-fold (P < 0.001) and 2.2-fold (P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, anti-BTN2A2 mAb also increased the infiltration of B cells, M1 macrophages, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in T cells, while reducing the infiltration of M2 macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Thus, anti-hBTN2A2 mAb normalizes the immunodeficient tumor microenvironment (TME) and inhibits tumor growth. Our results suggest that targeting the BTN2A2 immune checkpoint may represent a novel strategy for cancer treatment, especially in immunosuppressive 'cold' tumors.\"},\n",

FP has been associated with the altered functioning of the microbiome-gut-brain axis affecting host emotions and social behavior. The altered levels of serotonin (5-HT), a key monoaminergic neurotransmitter at both terminals of the gut-brain axis, affect the development of abnormal behavior, such as FP in laying hens. However, the underlying mechanism involving reciprocal interactions along the microbiota-gut-brain axis, particularly about the metabolism of 5-HT, remains unclear in FP phenotypes. This study examined the microbiota diversity, intestinal microbial metabolites, inflammatory responses, and 5-HT metabolism in divergently selected high (HFP; n\\xa0=\\xa08) and low (LFP; n\\xa0=\\xa08) FP hens to investigate the possible interconnections between FP behavior and the examined parameters. The 16S rRNA analysis revealed that compared to LFP birds, the gut microbiota of HFP birds exhibited a decrease in the abundance of phylum Firmicutes and genera Lactobacillus, while an increase in the abundance of phylum Proteobacteria and genera Escherichia Shigella and Desulfovibrio. Furthermore, the intestinal differential metabolites associated with FP phenotypes were mainly enriched in the tryptophan metabolic pathway. HFP birds had higher tryptophan metabolites and possibly a more responsive immune system compared to the LFP birds. This was indirectly supported by altered TNF-α levels in the serum and expression of inflammatory factor in the gut and brain. Moreover, HFP birds had lower serum levels of tryptophan and 5-HT compared to LFP birds, which was consistent with the downregulation of 5-HT metabolism-related genes in the brain of HFP birds. The correlation analysis revealed that genera Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio were associated with differences in intestinal metabolites, 5-HT metabolism, and inflammatory response between the LFP and HFP birds. In conclusion, differences in the cecal microbiota profile, immune response and 5-HT metabolism drive FP phenotypes, which could be associated with the gut abundance of genera Lactobacillus and Desulfovibrio.'},\n",

It is manifested by a loss of peristalsis in the lower part of the esophagus and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to relax. Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a minimally invasive intervention that aims to treat achalasia. It is regarded as the endoscopic equivalent of Heller myotomy. POEM is a form of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery that is completed by creating a submucosal tunnel in the lower part of esophagus to reach the inner circular muscle bundles of the LES to perform myotomy, while preserving the outer longitudinal muscle bundles. The result is decreased resting pressure of the LES, facilitating the passage of ingested material. POEM was initially introduced to treat achalasia by targeting the LES.

Three laparoscopic approaches were used: conventional laparoscopic pull-through (CLP) in 30 patients between 2009 and 2013, single-incision laparoscopic pull-through (SILP) in 28 patients between 2010 and 2013, and hybrid single-incision laparoscopic pull-through (H-SILP) in 32 patients between 2011 and 2013. We applied the hybrid version of the single-incision approach in 2011 to preserve the cosmetic advantage of SILP and the ergonomic advantage of CLP. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data, cosmetic results, and ergonomics of these three approaches to have a better understanding of the selection of one approach over another. The CLP, SILP, and H-SILP groups were similar in regard to age, sex, transition zone, blood loss, hospital stay, and intraoperative complications. Early and late postoperative results were not different, with equal daily defecation frequency and postoperative complications. No conversion to open technique was needed and none of the patients had recurrent constipation. With proper training, the ergonomics challenges were overcome and similar operative times were registered for the general operative time in the patients < 1 year of age and the short-segment HD patients. However, significantly shorter operative times were registered compared to SILP for patients > 1 year of age (CLP and H-SILP: 120 ± 15 min and 119 ± 12 min, respectively, vs 140 ± 7 min; P < 0.05) and for long-segment HD patients (152 ± 3.5 min and 154 ± 3.6 min, respectively, vs 176 ± 2.3 min; P < 0.05). The best cosmetic result was registered with the SILP (scarless), followed by the H-SILP (near scarless appearance) and the CLP (visible scars) procedures. Based on the results, we believed that the laparoscopic approach should be selected according to the age, transition zone, and desired cosmetic result.\"},\n",

The inverse variance weighting method was the main method used to estimate the association, and sensitivity analyses were also performed. A greater risk of erectile dysfunction was significantly associated with a higher genetic susceptibility to leisure computer usage (odds ratio\\xa0=\\xa03.57; 95% confidence interval =\\xa01.78-7.16; p\\xa0<\\xa00.001).

Extended computer usage for leisure raised the likelihood of developing erectile dysfunction, which may be associated to lower follicle-stimulating hormone levels; however, the role of endothelial dysfunction and psychological disorders in the development of erectile dysfunction should not be underestimated. Moderate physical activity may help to correct the dysfunction.

This process involves using a trained model to generate pseudo labels to the unlabeled samples, which are then incorporated to further train the original model, resulting in a new model. However, if these pseudo labels contain substantial errors, the resulting model's accuracy may drop, potentially falling below the performance of the initial model. To tackle the problem, we propose an Ambiguity-Aware Semi-Supervised Learning method for Leaf Disease Classification. Specifically, we present a per-disease ambiguity rejection algorithm that eliminates ambiguous results, thereby enhancing the precision of pseudo labels for the subsequent semi-supervised training step and improving the precision of the final classifier. The proposed method is evaluated on two public leaf disease datasets of coffee and banana across various data scenarios, including supervised and semi-supervised settings, with varying proportions of labeled data. The results indicate that our semi-supervised method reduces the reliance for fully labeled datasets while preserving high accuracy by utilizing the ambiguity rejection algorithm. Additionally, the rejection algorithm significantly boosts precision of final classifier on both coffee and banana datasets, achieving rates of 99.46% and 100.0%, respectively, while using only 50% labeled data. The study also presents a thorough set of experiments and analyses to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art supervised approaches.

Although many studies regarding the differences between the two disorders by immunohistochemical studies exist, there is as yet no consistent result. The purpose of this research was to study the immunohistochemical findings of enteric nervous system in these two motility disorders in comparison with colectomies without motility disorder. Full wall thickness specimens of three groups of patients (HD, IND B and non motility disorders) were included in the study to be evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Markers were specific for neuronal cells and pace maker cells composed of PGP 9.5, c-kit, synaptophysin, S100 and CD56. The number of cells was evaluated in the muscularis properia, and myenteric plexus. The number of all the IHC markers i.e. PGP9.5, c-kit, synaptophysin, S100 and CD56 was completely different in HD from the two other groups, while IND B was quite similar to control group. Our finding suggests that there is a marked and significant difference between HD and IND B by IHC markers, which can be used as an additional test for the diagnosis of HD with more accuracy. Further multicenter studies with a greater number of cases would be necessary to find a cut-off point for every IHC marker to differentiate HD and IND B.\"},\n",

We explored the genetic architecture of stroke classified as undetermined to test if mechanisms and risk factors underlying large-artery atherosclerotic (LAAS), cardioembolic (CES), and small-vessel stroke (SVS) contribute to its pathogenesis. We analyzed genome-wide data from 16,851 ischemic stroke cases and 32,473 controls. Using polygenic risk scores for LAAS, CES, and SVS, we assessed the genetic overlap with stroke of undetermined source and used pairwise genomewide association study (GWAS-PW) to search for shared loci. We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potentially causal risk factors of stroke of undetermined source. Genetic risk for LAS, CES, and SVS was associated with stroke of undetermined source pointing to overlap in their genetic architecture. Pairwise analyses revealed 19 shared loci with LAAS, 2 with CES, and 5 with SVS that have been implicated in atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Genetic liability to both carotid atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation was associated with stroke of undetermined source, but the association with atrial fibrillation was attenuated after excluding cases with incomplete diagnostic workup. MR analyses showed effects of genetically determinants of blood pressure, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, MCP-1/CCL2 levels), and factor XI levels on stroke of undetermined source. Stroke of undetermined source shares genetic and vascular risk factors with other stroke subtypes, especially LAAS, thus highlighting the diagnostic limitations of current subtyping approaches.

In the period from January 2001 to June 2008, we recruited 29 patients with TCA who were treated with the Martin procedure (14) or the Soave procedure (15). Relevant data were collected from the medical charts kept in the hospital library. The follow-up study used a detailed questionnaire that was answered by patients either by telephone or directly in the clinic. In the clinic, data, including age, body weight before operation, intraoperative blood transfusion, anastomotic leakage, postoperative enterocolitis, durations of any postoperative fever, days in hospital, and a range of functional outcomes, were particularly recorded to enable a comparison of the effectiveness of the Soave procedure and the Martin procedure. A male predominance has been described for patients with TCA, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 6.25:1. In the Soave group, time between ileostomy and the definitive procedure, body weight before the definitive procedure, and the operative age were less than those in the Martin group (P < .05). In patients who underwent the Martin procedure, the average duration of postoperative fever and days in hospital were significantly more than those in the Soave group (P < .05). In the Soave group, the incidence of intraoperative blood transfusion (46.7%), abdominal wound infection (6.67%), and anastomotic leakage (0) was significantly less (P < .05) than those in the Martin group (92.8%, 28.5%, and 14.3%, respectively). In the follow-up study, 7 patients in the Martin group had enterocolitis, and 4 of them had severe enterocolitis leading to multiple hospitalizations. In contrast, in the Soave group, only 2 patients had enterocolitis, and 1 was ameliorated after the therapy of anus dilation in the clinic. During the 4 weeks after the operation, all patients had an increased frequency of defecation, with soiling in the perianal area. At 3 months after the operation, there were significantly more patients with normal defecation in the Martin group compared to the Soave group (P < .05). Six months later, 11 (78.6%) patients in the Martin group and 8 (61.5%) patients in the Soave group had normal defecation and the difference was still significant (P < .05). Patients with TCA managed with the Soave procedure had fewer operative complications compared with those of patients who underwent the Martin procedure. However, the patients managed with the Soave procedure took longer to establish normal defecation. Although each procedure has advantages and disadvantages, the Soave procedure is promising for the treatment of TCA, especially with regard to postoperative complications.

       "   'abstract': 'Based on previous research, it is well-established that myasthenia gravis (MG) is linked to chronic inflammation. However, the exact nature of the relationship between inflammatory factors and the development of MG remains unclear. Consequently, the objective of this study is to explore whether alterations in the levels of inflammatory factors, as influenced by genetic factors, are associated with the occurrence of MG. This will be achieved through a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), encompassing 1873 MG cases and 36,370 individuals of European ancestry as controls. Data on inflammatory cytokines were obtained from GWAS data of 8293, healthy participants. The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was primarily employed to investigate the causal relationship between exposure and outcome. Additionally, various sensitivity analysis methods such as MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, weighted mode, and MR-PRESSO were applied to strengthen the reliability of the results. Through these rigorous approaches, we extensively examined the relationship between inflammatory factors and MG; however, further research is required to establish the specific causal relationship. After applying Bonferroni correction, the genetic predictions revealed a significant correlation between Monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) and MG (OR: 1.09, 95\\xa0% CI: 1.04-1.14; P\\xa0=\\xa00.0006). Furthermore, there were preliminary findings indicating a positive genetic association between Eotaxin and interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (IL-2ra) with MG (OR: 0.81, 95\\xa0% CI: 0.66-0.99, P\\xa0=\\xa00.044; OR: 0.80, 95\\xa0% CI: 0.68-0.94, P\\xa0=\\xa00.008). Reverse MR analysis provided initial evidence of associations between MIP1α, GROa, IL-13, TRAIL, IL-2ra, and IL-1ra with the development of MG. No indications of pleiotropy or heterogeneity among genetic variants were observed (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). This study uncovers a new connection between inflammatory cytokines and MG, shedding light on potential factors contributing to the development of the disease. Elevated levels of Eotaxin and IL-2ra are associated with a higher risk of MG, while indicating that MIG, MIP1α, GROa, IL-13, TRAIL, IL-2ra, and IL-1ra may be elevated as a result of MG, Especially MIG.

       "   'abstract': \"In this perspective review, we assess fundamental flaws in Darwinian evolution, including its modern versions. Fixed mutations 'explain' microevolution but not macroevolution including speciation events and the origination of all the major body plans of the Cambrian explosion. Complex, multifactorial change is required for speciation events and inevitably requires self-organization beyond what is accomplished by known mechanisms. The assembly of ribosomes and ATP synthase are specific examples. We propose their origin is a model for what is unexplained in biological evolution. Probability of evolution is modeled in Section 9 and values are absurdly improbable. Speciation and higher taxonomic changes become exponentially less probable as the number of required, genetically-based events increase. Also, the power required of the proposed selection mechanism (survival of the fittest) is nil for any biological advance requiring multiple changes, because they regularly occur in multiple generations (different genomes) and would not be selectively conserved by the concept survival of the fittest (a concept ultimately centered on the individual). Thus, survival of the fittest cannot 'explain' the origin of the millions of current and extinct species. We also focus on the inadequacies of laboratory chemistry to explain the complex, required biological self-organization seen in cells. We propose that a 'bioelectromagnetic' field/principle emerges in living cells. Synthesis by self-organization of massive molecular complexes involves biochemical responses to this emergent field/principle. There are ramifications for philosophy, science, and religion. Physics and mathematics must be more strongly integrated with biology and integration should receive dedicated funding with special emphasis for medical applications; treatment of cancer and genetic diseases are examples.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"While gastrointestinal tumors remain a multifactorial and prevalent group of malignancies commonly treated surgically in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, advancements regarding immunotherapeutic approaches continue to occur. Entering a new era of immunotherapy focused on overcoming resistance to preceding therapies caused the emergence of new therapeutic strategies. A promising solution surfaces with a V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), a negative regulator of a T-cell function expressed in hematopoietic cells. Due to VISTA's ability to act as both a ligand and a receptor, several therapeutic approaches can be potentially developed. A broad expression of VISTA was discovered on various tumor-growth-controlling cells, which proved to increase in specific tumor microenvironment (TME) conditions, thus serving as a rationale behind the development of new VISTA-targeting. Nevertheless, VISTA's ligands and signaling pathways are still not fully understood. The uncertain results of clinical trials suggest the need for future examining inhibitor agents for VISTA and implicating a double immunotherapeutic blockade. However, more research is needed before the breakthrough can be achieved. This review discusses perspectives and novel approaches presented in the current literature. Based on the results of the ongoing studies, VISTA might be considered a potential target in combined therapy, especially for treating gastrointestinal malignancies.\"},\n",

Two waves of data from the CHARLS database for 2011 and 2015 were used in this study. All possible sarcopenia participants met the Asia Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 (AWGS 2019) diagnostic criteria.

Psoriasis affects 2-3% of the population; it is associated with cardiovascular comorbidities, and in up to 30% of the cases, with psoriatic arthritis.

This study wishes to employed Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate the causal relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and HG. We employed Tow-Sample MR analysis to investigate the causal associations between LDL-C and HG. Specific variables were selected from GWAS database for MR analysis, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as our instruments. The threshold for significant SNPs as genetic instruments has been set at 5\\u2009×\\u200910 Our MR results identified the effect of genetically predicted increased LDL-C levels on increased genetic susceptibility to HG ( This study may have provided evidence of genetically predicted increased LDL-C levels on increased genetic susceptibility to HG. Appropriate lowering LDL-C levels may serve as a preventive and treatment measure for HG.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'A high-resolution linkage map of the lethal spotting locus: a mouse model for Hirschsprung disease.',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Mice homozygous for the lethal spotting (ls) mutation exhibit aganglionic megacolon and a white spotted coat owing to a lack of neural crest-derived enteric ganglia and melanocytes. The ls mutation disrupts the migration, differentiation, or survival of these neural crest lineages during mammalian development. A human congenital disorder, Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), is also characterized by aganglionic megacolon of the distal bowel and can be accompanied by hypopigmentation of the skin. HSCR has been attributed to multiple loci acting independently or in combination. The ls mouse serves as one animal model for HSCR, and the ls gene may represent one of the loci responsible for some cases of HSCR in humans. This study uses 753 N2 progeny from a combination of three intersubspecific backcrosses to define the molecular genetic linkage map of the ls region and to provide resources necessary for positional cloning. Similar to some cases of HSCR, the ls mutation acts semidominantly, its phenotypic effects dependent upon the presence of modifier genes segregating in the crosses. We have now localized the ls mutation to a 0.8-cM region between the D2Mit113 and D2Mit73/D2Mit174 loci. Three genes, endothelin-3 (Edn3), guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-stimulating polypeptide 1 (Gnas), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) were assessed as candidates for the ls mutation. Only Edn3 and Gnas did not recombine with the ls mutation. Mutational analysis of the Edn3 and Gnas genes will determine whether either gene is responsible for the neural crest deficiencies observed in ls/ls mice.'},\n",

       "   'title': 'Association between muscular strength and sleep quality in older adults undergoing hemodialysis: a cross-sectional study.',\n",
       "   'abstract': 'Older adults undergoing hemodialysis experience improved survival rates but often suffer from sleep disorders, resulting in adverse health outcomes. This study aims to assess the association between handgrip strength (HGS), a key indicator of muscular strength, and sleep quality in older adults undergoing hemodialysis. This cross-sectional and analytical study assessed 150 older adults undergoing hemodialysis selected by simple randomization. Data on demographics, clinical parameters, HGS, and sleep quality (PSQI) were collected and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with SPSS version 20. The mean age of the participants was 65.61\\u2009±\\u20094.07\\xa0years. Mean mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) and calf circumference (CC) were 29.59\\xa0cm and 36.96\\xa0cm, respectively. The mean HGS was 28.7\\u2009±\\u20098.55\\xa0kg, with males exhibiting higher HGS (37.72\\u2009±\\u20096.17\\xa0kg) than females (23.55\\u2009±\\u20095.38\\xa0kg). The mean PSQI score was 6.71, with 54.1% reporting poor sleep quality. Sleep quality was significantly associated with income source, underlying diseases, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), BMI, MUAC, CC, HGS, and blood levels of potassium and creatinine. A moderate negative correlation (r\\u2009=\\u2009-\\xa00.438, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) was observed between HGS and PSQI scores, indicating better sleep quality with greater muscular strength. Elevated potassium levels increase the risk of poor sleep. Older adults undergoing hemodialysis frequently experience poor sleep quality, which is associated with lower muscular strength. These findings highlight the importance of implementing targeted interventions, such as strength-training programs, to improve muscular strength and, consequently, sleep quality in this vulnerable population.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Cold ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a multifactorial process detrimental to liver graft function during liver transplantation (LT). Although flushing hepatic grafts prior to reperfusion have been well explored, the optimal graft rinse solution to prevent cold IR injury remains largely undefined. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a new rinse solution combining polyethylene glycol PM 35,000 Da (PEG35) with lactated solution (RLS) could mitigate cold IR injury in Wistar rats. Livers were isolated, preserved for 24\\xa0h and flushed immediately before ex vivo reperfusion with either RLS or PEG35-enriched RLS. Liver injury, graft function, energy balance, autophagy, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory response were assessed. Flushing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS resulted in decreased transaminase levels after cold ischemia. The improved graft function was evidenced by increased bile flow, enhanced BSP clearance, and reduced vascular resistance in these flushed grafts. Phospho-AMPK protein expression, as well as LC3B gene and protein expression were significantly increased compared to those unflushed and flushed only with RLS. PEG35-enriched RLS also maintained the oxidative state, as indicated by reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased MDA concentration. Additionally, this graft rinse solution down-regulated the inflammatory response by inhibiting the expression of genes involved in the HMGB-1/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway. These data strongly suggest that rinsing liver grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS prior to reperfusion represents a simple and cost-effective strategy to enhance liver functional recovery after cold IR injury. This approach could serve as a viable alternative to RLS in clinical applications, highlighting the need for further research to explore its broader implications.'},\n",
