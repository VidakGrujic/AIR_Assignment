We have used family-based association studies to identify a disease interval, and integrated this with comparative and functional genomic analysis to prioritize conserved and functional elements within which mutations can be sought. We now show that a common non-coding RET variant within a conserved enhancer-like sequence in intron 1 is significantly associated with HSCR susceptibility and makes a 20-fold greater contribution to risk than rare alleles do.

Decreased disaccharidase activities in amniotic fluid have been reported previously in association with other forms of intestinal obstruction. At 15 weeks' gestation, normal amniotic fluid disaccharidase levels were obtained. Serial ultrasound evaluations did not indicate any pathology, and the results from amniography were inconclusive. The implication of the normal disaccharidase values is that Hirschsprung disease may in some cases result from degeneration of intestinal ganglia after 16 weeks' gestation rather than from faulty migration of neural crest cells. The inheritance of Hirschsprung disease is generally consistent with sex-modified multifactorial inheritance with a lower threshold of expression in males. The case we report has a family history of three affected first- and second-degree relatives.

In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and their parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold susceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European ancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within the intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. With in vitro assays, we now show that the T variant disrupts a SOX10 binding site within MCS+9.7 that compromises RET transactivation. The T allele, with a control frequency of 20%-30%/47% and case frequency of 54%-62%/88% in European/Chinese-ancestry individuals, is involved in all forms of HSCR.

It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations. A number of other autosomal recessive syndromes include the Shah-Waardenburg, the Bardet-Biedl and Cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndromes and other syndromes related to cholesterol and fat metabolism among others. The genetics of Hirschsprung's disease are highly complex with the majority of known genetic sites relating to the main susceptibility pathways (RET an EDNRB). Non-syndromic non-familial, short-segment HSCR appears to represent a non-Mendelian condition with variable expression and sex-dependent penetrance. Syndromic and familial forms, on the other hand, have complex patterns of inheritance and being reported as autosomal dominant, recessive and polygenic patterns of inheritance. The phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance observed in Hirschsprung's disease could also be explained by the involvement of modifier genes, especially in its syndromic forms. In this review, we look at the chromosomal and Mendelian associations and their underlying signalling pathways, to obtain a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in developing aganglionosis of the distal bowel.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8896569', 'title': 'Germline mutations of the RET ligand GDNF are not sufficient to cause Hirschsprung disease.', 'abstract': 'Hirschsprung disease (HSCR, aganglionic megacolon) is a common congenital malformation leading to bowel obstruction, with an incidence of 1/5,000 live births. It is characterized by the absence of intrinsic ganglion cells in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses along variable lengths of the gastrointestinal tract. As enteric neurons are derived from the vagal neural crest, HSCR is regarded as a neurocristopathy. On the basis of a skewed sex-ratio (M/F = 4/1) and a risk to relatives much higher than the incidence in the general population, HSCR has long been regarded as a sex-modified multifactorial disorder. Accordingly, segregation analysis suggested an incompletely penetrant dominant inheritance in HSCR families with aganglionosis extending beyond the sigmoid colon. We and others have mapped a dominant gene for HSCR to chromosome 10q11.2 and have ascribed the disease to mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. However, the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation, the low penetrance and the sex-dependent effect of RET mutations supported the existence of one or more modifier gene(s) in familial HSCR. In addition, thus far, RET mutations only accounted for 50% and 15-20% of familial and sporadic HSCR patients, respectively. RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor whose ligand was unknown. Recently, the Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has been identified to be a ligand for RET. Moreover, Gdnf-/- knockout mutant mice display congenital intestinal aganglionosis and renal agenesis, a phenotype very similar to the Ret-/- mouse.

For example, in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), these models can be applied to describe progression in T2D by predefining several T2D states based on available biometric measurements such as hemoglobin A1 C (HbA1c). In most cases, MSMs come with an assumption that the examination process is independent of disease progression. However, in practice, complete independence between disease progression and examination processes is unrealistic, as the frequency at which a patient accesses healthcare may vary based on treatment and/or control of the health condition. We built a joint model of a 4-state transition process of T2D with informative examination scheme (i.e., the patterns of examination times are not random). Risk factors including age, sex, race, and socioeconomic disadvantage were included in a log-linear model examining T2D transition intensities and healthcare visit frequencies. Parameters of the joint model are estimated under the framework of likelihood function by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The joint model demonstrated that people living in neighborhoods with greater socioeconomic disadvantage had a lower healthcare visit frequency under all 4 defined T2D statuses. Evaluation of race/ethnicity revealed that comparing to non-Hispanic White patients, Black patients had higher risk for progressing from Normal to Prediabetes, T2D, and Uncontrolled T2D states. Our joint model offers a framework for analyzing multistate survival processes while accounting for the dependence between disease progression and examination frequency.

In this report, we present a case of ADHD with intestinal ulcers as the initial gastrointestinal manifestation, and subsequent pathological examination revealed the presence of amyloid deposits in the colonic mucosa. A male patient, aged 20, exhibited recurring abdominal distension and intestinal obstruction for a duration of three years. Multiple colonoscopies revealed the presence of recurrent colonic ulcers, with pathological examination indicating the existence of amyloid deposits within the mucosal layer of the colon. Abdominal CT scans suggested colonic dilatation. Following a multidisciplinary consultation, a subtotal resection of the colon was performed, and subsequent postoperative pathology confirmed a decrease and absence of myenteric plexus ganglion cells. Considering the patient's symptoms and the findings from the postoperative pathology, a diagnosis of ADHD was made. The patient's symptoms resolved postoperatively and he was discharged from the hospital and followed up for 1 year in stable condition. Our study highlights the potential association between ADHD and the initial presentation of recurrent colonic ulcers, accompanied by amyloid deposition in the intestinal mucosa.

The multifactorial causes of obesity include several genetic, dietary and lifestyle variables that together result in an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Dietary approaches to limit fat intake are commonly prescribed to achieve the hypocaloric conditions necessary for weight loss. But dietary fat restriction is often accompanied by increased carbohydrate intake, which can dramatically increase endogenous fatty acid synthesis depending upon carbohydrate composition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the transanal 1-stage endorectal pull-through operation in the management of rectosigmoid HD. Fifty-eight children (39 boys and 19 girls) aged 12 months to 13 years (mean, 2 years) who underwent transanal 1-stage endorectal pull-through operation for HD were followed up from 6 to 24 months. Clinical outcome was assessed by interviews and questionnaires. All patients had an aganglionic segment confined to the rectosigmoid area which was confirmed by the preoperative barium enema and postoperative pathological examination. Forty-six patients had satisfactory results without complications. In all the children, the mean stool times were 1 to 2 per day; only 4 had mean stool times of 8 to 10 per day. Postoperative soiling was present in 9, constipation in 5, and HD-associated enterocolitis in 3. There were no incontinence, cuff infection, anastomotic leak, and mortality in any of the patients. In the 12 symptomatic patients, there were 4 children with length of aganglionic segment less than 30 cm, and 8 had 30 cm or more. In the 46 asymptomatic patients, 42 had length of aganglionic segment less than 30 cm, and 4 had 30 cm or more. There was a significant difference between the group with less than 30 cm and the group with 30 cm or more of aganglionic segment. For statistical analysis, the Fisher exact test showed P < .05. The transanal 1-stage endorectal pull-through is a feasible and safe procedure in children with rectosigmoid HD. The clinical outcome is satisfactory. A gradual recovery could be noted in the stooling patterns along with the time after surgery.

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure(CNKI), Wanfang, Chinese Biomedical Literature and Weipu (VIP) databases to collect information on the epidemiology of cognitive frailty among older adults in China. The study period was from the establishment of the database to March 2022. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata V.15.0. We screened 522 records, of which 28 met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of cognitive frailty among older adults in China was 15%(95%CI (0.13%,0.17%)). The prevalence of cognitive frailty was higher in hospitals and nursing homes than in communities. Moreover, the prevalence of cognitive frailty was higher in women than in men. Furthermore, the prevalence rates of cognitive frailty in North China Hospital, older adults aged≥80 years, and illiterate individuals were 25%, 29%, and 55%, respectively. In conclusion, in China, the prevalence of cognitive frailty is higher among older adults, is higher in women than in men, is higher in hospitals and nursing homes than in communities, and is higher in North China than other regions. Moreover, the higher the educational level, the lower the prevalence of cognitive frailty. Multimodal interventions for cognitive frailty, including increased exercise, nutritional support, increased socialisation opportunities and multifactorial strategies, may be effective in preventing cognitive frailty. These findings have important implications for adjusting healthcare and social care systems.

To facilitate the interrogation of putatively pathogenic hexamer variants, we set out to define functionally important hexamers genome-wide as a resource for research and clinical testing interrogation. We identified predominant polyA sites (herein referred to as pPAS) and putative predominant hexamers across protein coding genes (PAS usage >50% per gene). As a measure of the validity of these sites, the population constraint of 4532 predominant hexamers were measured. The predominant hexamers had fewer observed variants compared to non-predominant hexamers and trimer controls, and CADD scores for variants in these hexamers were significantly higher than controls. Exome data for 1477 individuals were interrogated for hexamer variants and transcriptome data were generated for 76 individuals with 65 variants in predominant hexamers. 3' RNA-seq data showed these variants resulted in alternate polyadenylation events (38%) and in elongated mRNA transcripts (12%). Our list of pPAS and predominant hexamers are available in the UCSC genome browser and on GitHub. We suggest this list of predominant hexamers can be used to interrogate exome and genome data.

In brain-joint axis, the neuroendocrine regulation, circadian rhythms, and leptin signaling influence joint tissues. We also discussed the role of prostaglandin E2 in skeletal interoception and its potential as a therapeutic target. The gut-joint axis is underscored by the impact of gut microbiota dysbiosis on systemic inflammation and metabolic disorders, both of which are implicated in OA pathogenesis. Furthermore, age-related sarcopenia, characterized by muscle mass and strength loss, is identified as a significant risk factor. Sarcopenia may contribute to OA progression through compromised mechanical support, systemic inflammation, and muscle-derived myokines.

The etiology of MS is multifactorial: Approximately 30% of the MS risk is genetic, which implies that the remaining ~70% is environmental, with a number of factors proposed. One recently implicated risk factor for MS is the composition of the gut microbiome. Numerous case-control studies have identified changes in gut microbiota composition of people with MS (pwMS) compared with healthy control individuals, and more recent studies in animal models have begun to identify the causative microbes and underlying mechanisms. Here, we review some of these mechanisms, with a specific focus on the role of host genetic variation, dietary inputs, and gut microbial metabolism, with a particular emphasis on short-chain fatty acid and tryptophan metabolism. We put forward a model where, in an individual genetically susceptible to MS, the gut microbiota and diet can synergize as potent environmental modifiers of disease risk and possibly progression, with diet-dependent gut microbial metabolites serving as a key mechanism. We also propose that specific microbial taxa may have divergent effects in individuals carrying distinct variants of MS risk alleles or other polymorphisms, as a consequence of host gene-by-gut microbiota interactions. Finally, we also propose that the effects of specific microbial taxa, especially those that exert their effects through metabolites, are highly dependent on the host dietary intake. What emerges is a complex multifaceted interaction that has been challenging to disentangle in human studies, contributing to the divergence of findings across heterogeneous cohorts with differing geography, dietary preferences, and genetics. Nonetheless, this provides a complex and individualized, yet tractable, model of how the gut microbiota regulate susceptibility to MS, and potentially progression of this disease. Thus, we conclude that prophylactic or therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiome to prevent or treat MS will require a careful and personalized consideration of host genetics, baseline gut microbiota composition, and dietary inputs.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37259495', 'title': 'Physical fitness trend after COVID-19 restrictions in Italian school-aged children: a cross-sectional study.', 'abstract': 'Physical fitness (PF) is a marker of health in children.

In total, 53 prenatal and postnatal variables were sequentially added into the three discrete models stratified by hospital days: (1) within 24 h (TL-1d), (2) from day 2 to day 7 after birth (TL-7d), (3) from day 8 after birth to discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (TL-dc). Each model predicted the mortality of VLBW infants within the affected period. Multilayer perception (MLP)-based network analysis was used for modeling, and ensemble analysis with traditional machine learning (ML) analysis was additionally applied. The performance of models was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values. The Shapley method was applied to reveal the contribution of each variable.

Non-human primates (NHPs) may serve as an excellent model to study LOAD because of their close similarity to humans in many aspects including neuroanatomy and neurodevelopment. Recent studies reveal AD-like pathology in old NHPs. In this pilot study, we took advantage of brain samples from 6 Cynomolgus macaques that were divided into two groups: middle aged (average age 14.81 years) and older (average age 19.33 years). We investigated whether AD-like brain pathologies are present in the NHPs. We used immunohistochemical method to examine brain Aβ pathology and neuron density. We applied biochemical assays to measure tau phosphorylation and multiple signaling pathways indicated in AD. We performed electron microscopy experiments to study alterations of postsynaptic density and mitochondrial morphology in the brain of NHPs. We found multiple AD-like pathological alteration in the prefrontal cortex (but not in the hippocampus) of the older NHPs including tau hyperphosphorylation, increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), decreased expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), impairments in mitochondrial morphology, and postsynaptic densities formation. These findings may provide insights into the factors contributing to the development of LOAD, particularly during the early stage transitioning from middle to old age.

Furthermore, the intestinal differential metabolites associated with FP phenotypes were mainly enriched in the tryptophan metabolic pathway. HFP birds had higher tryptophan metabolites and possibly a more responsive immune system compared to the LFP birds. This was indirectly supported by altered TNF-α levels in the serum and expression of inflammatory factor in the gut and brain. Moreover, HFP birds had lower serum levels of tryptophan and 5-HT compared to LFP birds, which was consistent with the downregulation of 5-HT metabolism-related genes in the brain of HFP birds.

Constipation is a major problem in patients operated for ARM, and biopsies from the distal rectum in patients with ARM may not show ganglion cells owing to different reasons, leading to a false positive diagnosis of HD. A pull-through procedure for HD after previous anorectoplasty for ARM always leads to fecal incontinence. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence of simultaneous diagnoses of ARM and HD in a single large cohort of ARM patients and to demonstrate that biopsies from the anal canal, which are negative for ganglion cells, may mislead to a diagnosis of HD. A retrospective review of our database from 1980 to 2018 identified 164 patients with HD and 2397 patients with ARM. Four patients suffered from both HD and ARM. The incidence of HD in ARM patients was 4/2397 = 0.17%, and the incidence of ARM in HD patients was 4/164 = 2.4%.

This process involves using a trained model to generate pseudo labels to the unlabeled samples, which are then incorporated to further train the original model, resulting in a new model. However, if these pseudo labels contain substantial errors, the resulting model's accuracy may drop, potentially falling below the performance of the initial model. To tackle the problem, we propose an Ambiguity-Aware Semi-Supervised Learning method for Leaf Disease Classification. Specifically, we present a per-disease ambiguity rejection algorithm that eliminates ambiguous results, thereby enhancing the precision of pseudo labels for the subsequent semi-supervised training step and improving the precision of the final classifier. The proposed method is evaluated on two public leaf disease datasets of coffee and banana across various data scenarios, including supervised and semi-supervised settings, with varying proportions of labeled data. The results indicate that our semi-supervised method reduces the reliance for fully labeled datasets while preserving high accuracy by utilizing the ambiguity rejection algorithm. Additionally, the rejection algorithm significantly boosts precision of final classifier on both coffee and banana datasets, achieving rates of 99.46% and 100.0%, respectively, while using only 50% labeled data. The study also presents a thorough set of experiments and analyses to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art supervised approaches. The results demonstrate that our method, despite using only 50% of the labeled data, achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised models that use 100% of the labeled data.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40245624', 'title': 'Metabolomics unravels the formation pathway of advanced glycation end products in preserved egg yolk mediated by OH', 'abstract': 'Metabolomics was first applied to explore the formation pathway and regulatory factors for advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in preserved egg yolk (PEY) during pickling.

Structural equation modeling was applied to test hypotheses. Child maltreatment was associated with more depressive symptoms (standardized β=0.29, P<0.001), more chronic health conditions (β=0.24, P<0.001), poorer psychological well-being (β=-0.25, P<0.001), and elevated C-reactive protein (β=0.06, P=0.041), but not with interleukin-6 (β=0.06, P=0.055). There were significant interaction effects between child maltreatment and psychological resources on depressive symptoms (unstandardized b=-0.009, SE=0.005, P=0.045) and interleukin-6 (b=-0.001, SE=0.000, P=0.042). Specifically, there were stronger relationships between child maltreatment and more depressive symptoms and elevated interleukin-6 at low levels of psychological resources than at high levels of psychological resources. There were no statistically significant interaction effects between child maltreatment and social resources on any health outcomes.

Among them, 60 cases treated with Soave radical operation alone were the control group (CG), and the other 66 cases with live combined Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus tablets and Soave radical operation were set as the observation group (OG). We compared the treatment efficacy, adverse effects, defecation function, and the number of intestinal flora and IgG and IgA levels at the time of admission and after 3 months of treatment between both groups of children. The efficacy efficiency and excellent defecation function rate were dramatically higher in the OG than in the CG after treatment (P<0.05). The bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and enterococcus faecalis were dramatically higher in the OG than in the CG after treatment (P<0.05), and the E. coli was dramatically lower than in the CG (P<0.05). After treatment, IgA and IgG in the OG were higher than those in the CG (P<0.05), and the incidence of postoperative complications was lower than that in the CG (P<0.05).

Several procedures exist for the treatment of TCA. However, there is no current consensus on a superior operative procedure. The objective of this article is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of the Soave procedure and the Martin procedure in the treatment of TCA with respect to preoperative data and postoperative outcome. In the period from January 2001 to June 2008, we recruited 29 patients with TCA who were treated with the Martin procedure (14) or the Soave procedure (15). Relevant data were collected from the medical charts kept in the hospital library. The follow-up study used a detailed questionnaire that was answered by patients either by telephone or directly in the clinic. In the clinic, data, including age, body weight before operation, intraoperative blood transfusion, anastomotic leakage, postoperative enterocolitis, durations of any postoperative fever, days in hospital, and a range of functional outcomes, were particularly recorded to enable a comparison of the effectiveness of the Soave procedure and the Martin procedure. A male predominance has been described for patients with TCA, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 6.25:1. In the Soave group, time between ileostomy and the definitive procedure, body weight before the definitive procedure, and the operative age were less than those in the Martin group (P < .05). In patients who underwent the Martin procedure, the average duration of postoperative fever and days in hospital were significantly more than those in the Soave group (P < .05). In the Soave group, the incidence of intraoperative blood transfusion (46.7%), abdominal wound infection (6.67%), and anastomotic leakage (0) was significantly less (P < .05) than those in the Martin group (92.8%, 28.5%, and 14.3%, respectively). In the follow-up study, 7 patients in the Martin group had enterocolitis, and 4 of them had severe enterocolitis leading to multiple hospitalizations. In contrast, in the Soave group, only 2 patients had enterocolitis, and 1 was ameliorated after the therapy of anus dilation in the clinic. During the 4 weeks after the operation, all patients had an increased frequency of defecation, with soiling in the perianal area. At 3 months after the operation, there were significantly more patients with normal defecation in the Martin group compared to the Soave group (P < .05). Six months later, 11 (78.6%) patients in the Martin group and 8 (61.5%) patients in the Soave group had normal defecation and the difference was still significant (P < .05). Patients with TCA managed with the Soave procedure had fewer operative complications compared with those of patients who underwent the Martin procedure. However, the patients managed with the Soave procedure took longer to establish normal defecation. Although each procedure has advantages and disadvantages, the Soave procedure is promising for the treatment of TCA, especially with regard to postoperative complications.

Consequently, the objective of this study is to explore whether alterations in the levels of inflammatory factors, as influenced by genetic factors, are associated with the occurrence of MG. This will be achieved through a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), encompassing 1873 MG cases and 36,370 individuals of European ancestry as controls.

Fixed mutations 'explain' microevolution but not macroevolution including speciation events and the origination of all the major body plans of the Cambrian explosion. Complex, multifactorial change is required for speciation events and inevitably requires self-organization beyond what is accomplished by known mechanisms. The assembly of ribosomes and ATP synthase are specific examples. We propose their origin is a model for what is unexplained in biological evolution. Probability of evolution is modeled in Section 9 and values are absurdly improbable. Speciation and higher taxonomic changes become exponentially less probable as the number of required, genetically-based events increase. Also, the power required of the proposed selection mechanism (survival of the fittest) is nil for any biological advance requiring multiple changes, because they regularly occur in multiple generations (different genomes) and would not be selectively conserved by the concept survival of the fittest (a concept ultimately centered on the individual). Thus, survival of the fittest cannot 'explain' the origin of the millions of current and extinct species. We also focus on the inadequacies of laboratory chemistry to explain the complex, required biological self-organization seen in cells. We propose that a 'bioelectromagnetic' field/principle emerges in living cells. Synthesis by self-organization of massive molecular complexes involves biochemical responses to this emergent field/principle. There are ramifications for philosophy, science, and religion. Physics and mathematics must be more strongly integrated with biology and integration should receive dedicated funding with special emphasis for medical applications; treatment of cancer and genetic diseases are examples.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40263521', 'title': 'Comparison of bariatric surgery and community weight management for idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a multicenter retrospective cohort study.', 'abstract': 'Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a neurological disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure without definitive etiology, primarily affecting young, obese women.

Due to VISTA's ability to act as both a ligand and a receptor, several therapeutic approaches can be potentially developed. A broad expression of VISTA was discovered on various tumor-growth-controlling cells, which proved to increase in specific tumor microenvironment (TME) conditions, thus serving as a rationale behind the development of new VISTA-targeting.

Livers were isolated, preserved for 24\\xa0h and flushed immediately before ex vivo reperfusion with either RLS or PEG35-enriched RLS. Liver injury, graft function, energy balance, autophagy, oxidative stress as well as inflammatory response were assessed. Flushing hepatic grafts with PEG35-enriched RLS resulted in decreased transaminase levels after cold ischemia. The improved graft function was evidenced by increased bile flow, enhanced BSP clearance, and reduced vascular resistance in these flushed grafts. Phospho-AMPK protein expression, as well as LC3B gene and protein expression were significantly increased compared to those unflushed and flushed only with RLS. PEG35-enriched RLS also maintained the oxidative state, as indicated by reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes and decreased MDA concentration. Additionally, this graft rinse solution down-regulated the inflammatory response by inhibiting the expression of genes involved in the HMGB-1/NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway.

Activation of EGFR requires binding of a ligand on the extracellular domain to promote conformational changes leading to dimerization and transphosphorylation of intracellular kinase domains. Seven ligands are known to bind EGFR with affinities ranging from sub-nanomolar to near micromolar dissociation constants. In the case of EGFR, distinct conformational states assumed upon binding a ligand is thought to be a determining factor in activation of a downstream signaling network. Previous biochemical studies suggest the existence of both low affinity and high affinity EGFR ligands. While these studies have identified functional effects of ligand binding, high-resolution structural data are lacking. To gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of EGFR binding affinities, we docked each EGFR ligand to the putative active state extracellular domain dimer and 25.0 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed. MM-PBSA/GBSA are efficient computational approaches to approximate free energies of protein-protein interactions and decompose the free energy at the amino acid level. We applied these methods to the last 6.0 ns of each ligand-receptor simulation. MM-PBSA calculations were able to successfully rank all seven of the EGFR ligands based on the two affinity classes: EGF>HB-EGF>TGF-α>BTC>EPR>EPG>AR. Results from energy decomposition identified several interactions that are common among binding ligands. These findings reveal that while several residues are conserved among the EGFR ligand family, no single set of residues determines the affinity class. Instead we found heterogeneous sets of interactions that were driven primarily by electrostatic and Van der Waals forces.

In clinical trials, however, TRAIL did not live up to the expectations, as tumors exhibit high rates of TRAIL resistance in vivo. Response to anti-cancer therapy is determined not only by cancer cell intrinsic factors (e.g. oncogenic mutations), but also modulated by extrinsic factors such as the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.Here, we address the effect of hypoxia on pro-apoptotic TRAIL signaling in colorectal cancer cells. We show that oxygen levels modulate susceptibility to TRAIL-induced cell death, which is severely impaired under hypoxia (0.5% O2). Mechanistically, this is attributable to hypoxia-induced mitochondrial autophagy. Loss of mitochondria under hypoxia restricts the availability of mitochondria-derived pro-apoptotic molecules such as second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC), thereby disrupting amplification of the apoptotic signal emanating from the TRAIL death receptors and efficiently blocking cell death in type-II cells. Moreover, we identify strategies to overcome TRAIL resistance in low oxygen environments. Counteracting hypoxia-induced loss of endogenous SMAC by exogenous substitution of SMAC mimetics fully restores TRAIL sensitivity in colorectal cancer cells. Alternatively, enforcing a mitochondria-independent type-I mode of cell death by targeting the type-II phenotype gatekeeper X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is equally effective.Together, our results indicate that tumor hypoxia impairs TRAIL efficacy but this limitation can be overcome by combining TRAIL with SMAC mimetics or XIAP-targeting drugs.

Inhibitors of ER as well as ErbB1 blocked the combined effects of E2 and EGF. Pretreatment with UO126 abolished the combined effects, demonstrating Erk1/2 requirement. Although bidirectionality in ER-ErbB1 cross-talk is a well-accepted paradigm, interestingly in lactotrophs, ErbB1 kinase inhibitor failed to block the effect of E2 on proliferation and stimulation of PRL gene expression, suggesting that ER does not require ErbB1 to mediate its effects. Furthermore, E2 did not affect the ability of EGF to induce c-Fos expression or modulate AP-1 activity. However, both E2 and EGF combine to enhance S118 phosphorylation of ERalpha, leading to enhanced E2-mediated estrogen response element transactivation. Taken together, our results suggest that, in lactotrophs, activated ErbB1 phosphorylates ERalpha to enhance the stimulatory effect of E2, thereby providing the molecular basis by which EGF amplifies the response of E2.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39818308', 'title': 'STAT3 orchestrates immune dynamics in hepatocellular carcinoma: A pivotal nexus in tumor progression.', 'abstract': 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presents a formidable challenge in oncology, attributed to its association with chronic liver diseases and global prevalence. The immune microenvironment profoundly influences HCC progression, balancing immune suppression and antitumor responses. The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is central to this equilibrium, orchestrating immune dynamics and intertwining tumor progression with immune evasion mechanisms. Dysregulated STAT3 signaling, activated by various stimuli, including cytokines and growth factors, promotes an immunosuppressive milieu within HCC tumors, fostering tumor survival and proliferation while hindering immune surveillance. Non-coding RNAs and other molecules regulate this process, modulating STAT3 activity and influencing immune cell function. Moreover, therapeutic interventions targeting the STAT3 pathway, alongside advancements in radiotherapy, cancer vaccines, and diabetes-related drugs, offer promising strategies in HCC management. Integrating natural compounds with immunotherapy emerges as a novel approach, leveraging their ability to enhance antitumor immunity and counter immune evasion strategies. Understanding the multifaceted role of STAT3 and its interactions within the immune landscape of HCC is paramount for devising effective therapeutic interventions and improving patient outcomes.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39245969', 'title': 'Decoding the mannose receptor-mAb interaction: the importance of high-mannose N-glycans and glycan-pairing.', 'abstract': 'During the development process of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it is crucial to control (critical) quality attributes such as N-glycosylation influencing pharmacokinetics (PK) and Fc effector functions. Previous reports have shown that mAbs containing high-mannose N-glycans are cleared faster from blood circulation, leading to reduced half-lives. The high-mannose N-glycan content of mAbs can be influenced during the cell culture process by factors such as cell lines, process conditions, and media. Furthermore, mAbs have either one high mannose N-glycan (asymmetrical high-mannose glyco-pair) or two high mannose N-glycans (symmetrical high-mannose glyco-pair). The hypothesis that the mannose receptor (MR, CD206) accelerates clearance by facilitating their internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation is widespread. However, the interaction between MR and mAbs has not been explicitly demonstrated. This study aimed to investigate this interaction, providing the first systematic demonstration of MR binding to the Fc region of mAbs with high-mannose N-glycans. Two novel analytical methods, MR surface plasmon resonance and MR affinity chromatography, were developed and applied to investigate the MR-mAb interaction. The interaction is found to be dependent on high-mannose content, but is independent of the mAb format or sequence. However, different glyco-pairs exhibited varying binding affinities to the MR, with the symmetrical high-mannose glyco-pair showing the strongest binding properties. These findings strengthen the hypothesis for the MR-mediated mAb interaction and contribute to a deeper understanding of the MR-mAb interaction, which could affect the criticality of high-mannose containing mAbs development strategies of IgG-based molecules and improve their PK profiles.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14581234', 'title': 'Influence of type I collagen surface density on fibroblast spreading, motility, and contractility.', 'abstract': 'We examine the relationships of three variables (projected area, migration speed, and traction force) at various type I collagen surface densities in a population of fibroblasts. We observe that cell area is initially an increasing function of ligand density, but that above a certain transition level, increases in surface collagen cause cell area to decline. The threshold collagen density that separates these two qualitatively different regimes, approximately 160 molecules/ microm(2), is approximately equal to the cell surface density of integrin molecules. These results suggest a model in which collagen density induces a qualitative transition in the fundamental way that fibroblasts interact with the substrate. At low density, the availability of collagen binding sites is limiting and the cells simply try to flatten as much as possible by pulling on the few available sites as hard as they can. The force per bond under these conditions approaches 100 pN, approximately equal to the force required for rupture of integrin-peptide bonds. In contrast, at high collagen density adhesion, traction force and motility are limited by the availability of free integrins on the cell surface since so many of these receptors are bound to the surface ligand and the force per bond is very low.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38202790', 'title': 'Optimization of the Flavonoid Extraction Process from the Stem and Leaves of Epimedium Brevicornum and Its Effects on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Renal Injury.', 'abstract': 'Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a broad-spectrum alkylated antitumor drug.

First, we screened for proteins related to PN using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), obtaining genetic data on plasma proteomes from 35,559 Icelanders. Summary data for six common PN, including Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN), Alcoholic Neuropathy (AIP), Drug-induced Neuropathy (DIP), Diabetic Neuropathy (DP), and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), were obtained from the FinnGen database.

The functional involvement of expression of the ErbB family of receptors and/or EGFR ligands was examined in CXCR4-expressing human gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts, clinical samples (primary tumors and ascites), and an animal model. High concentration of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), as well as of CXCL12, were present in malignant ascites. Human gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric tumors, with high potential to generate peritoneal carcinomatosis, expressed high levels of EGFR and CXCR4 mRNA and protein. Both amphiregulin and HB-EGF enhanced the proliferation, migration, and functional CXCR4 expression in highly CXCR4-expressing gastric cancer NUGC4 cells. Amphiregulin strongly enhanced the proliferation of NUGC4 cells, whereas HB-EGF markedly induced the migration of fibroblasts. Moreover, HB-EGF and CXCL12 together enhanced TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent amphiregulin shedding from NUGC4 cells. In an experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis model in mice, cetuximab effectively reduced tumor growth and ascites formation.

The tumor cells also overexpressed c-FLIP to keep caspases away from TRAILR2 in case FADD finds a way back to the death receptor.

This study aimed to investigate the role of PPARs in the suppressive effect of BBR on HCC and to elucidate the relative mechanism. We studied the role of PPARs in the anti-HCC effects of BBR both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism whereby BBR regulated PPARs was studied using real-time PCR, immunoblotting, immunostaining, luciferase, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled PCR assay. Additionally, we used adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene knockdown to address the effect of BBR more effectively. We demonstrated that PPARδ played an active role in the anti-HCC effect of BBR, rather than PPARα or PPARγ. Following a PPARδ-dependent manner, BBR increased BAX, cleaved Caspase 3, and decreased BCL2 expression to trigger apoptotic death, thereby suppressing HCC development both in vitro and in vivo. It was noted that the interactions between PPARδ and the apoptotic pathway resulted from the BBR-induced upregulation of the PPARδ transcriptional function; that is, the BBR-induced activation of PPARδ could mediate the binding with the promoters of apoptotic genes such as Caspase 3, BAX, and BCL2. Moreover, gut microbiota also contributed to the suppressive effect of BBR on HCC. We found that BBR treatment restored the dysregulated gut microbiota induced by the liver tumor burden, and a functional gut microbial metabolite, butyric acid (BA), acted as a messenger in the gut microbiota-liver axis. Unlike BBR, the effects of BA suppressing HCC and activating PPARδ were not potent. However, BA was able to enhance the efficacy of BBR by reducing PPARδ degradation through a mechanism to inhibit the proteasome ubiquitin system. Additionally, we found that the anti-HCC effect of BBR or a combination of BBR and BA was much weaker in mice with AAV-mediated PPARδ knockdown than those in the control mice, suggesting the critical role of PPARδ. In summary, this study is the first to report that a liver-gut microbiota-PPARδ trilogy contributes to the anti-HCC effect of BBR. BBR not only directly activated PPARδ to trigger apoptotic death but also promoted gut microbiota-derived BA production, which could reduce PPARδ degradation to enhance the efficacy of BBR.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659311', 'title': 'Expedited mapping of the ligandable proteome using fully functionalized enantiomeric probe pairs.', 'abstract': \"A fundamental challenge in chemical biology and medicine is to understand and expand the fraction of the human proteome that can be targeted by small molecules.

Common complex biological samples include blood, serum, saliva, and urine. At present, the main methods used to separate and recognize target analytes in complex biological systems are electrophoresis, spectroscopy, and chromatography. However, because biological samples consist of complex components, they suffer from the matrix effect, which seriously affects the accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability of the selected separation analysis technique. In addition to the matrix effect, the detection of trace components is challenging because the content of the analyte in the sample is usually very low. Moreover, reasonable strategies for sample enrichment and signal amplification for easy analysis are lacking. In response to the various issues described above, researchers have focused their attention on immuno-affinity technology with the aim of achieving efficient sample separation based on the specific recognition effect between antigens and antibodies. Following a long period of development, this technology is now widely used in fields such as disease diagnosis, bioimaging, food testing, and recombinant protein purification. Common immuno-affinity technologies include solid-phase extraction (SPE) magnetic beads, affinity chromatography columns, and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Immuno-affinity techniques can successfully reduce or eliminate the matrix effect; however, their applications are limited by a number of disadvantages, such as high costs, tedious fabrication procedures, harsh operating conditions, and ligand leakage. Thus, developing an effective and reliable method that can address the matrix effect remains a challenging endeavor. Similar to the interactions between antigens and antibodies as well as enzymes and substrates, biomimetic molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) exhibit high specificity and affinity. Furthermore, compared with many other biomacromolecules such as antigens and aptamers, MIPs demonstrate higher stability, lower cost, and easier fabrication strategies, all of which are advantageous to their application. Therefore, molecular imprinting technology (MIT) is frequently used in SPE, chromatographic separation, and many other fields. With the development of MIT, researchers have engineered different types of imprinting strategies that can specifically extract the target analyte in complex biological samples while simultaneously avoiding the matrix effect. Some traditional separation technologies based on MIP technology have also been studied in depth; the most common of these technologies include stationary phases used for chromatography and adsorbents for SPE. Analytical methods that combine MIT with highly sensitive detection technologies have received wide interest in fields such as disease diagnosis and bioimaging.

Following damage, complex physiological events are required in the gut to maintain proper homeostasis. Previously, we demonstrated that ingestion of a nonlethal pathogen, Erwinia carotovora carotovora 15, induces a massive increase in stem cell proliferation in the gut of Drosophila. However, the precise cellular events that occur following infection have not been quantitatively described, nor do we understand the interaction between multiple pathways that have been implicated in epithelium renewal. To understand the process of infection and epithelium renewal in more detail, we performed a quantitative analysis of several cellular and morphological characteristics of the gut. We observed that the gut of adult Drosophila undergoes a dynamic remodeling in response to bacterial infection. This remodeling coordinates the synthesis of new enterocytes, their proper morphogenesis and the elimination of damaged cells through delamination and anoikis. We demonstrate that one signaling pathway, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, is key to controlling each of these steps through distinct functions in intestinal stem cells and enterocytes. The EGFR pathway is activated by the EGF ligands, Spitz, Keren and Vein, the latter being induced in the surrounding visceral muscles in part under the control of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Additionally, the EGFR pathway synergizes with the JAK/STAT pathway in stem cells to promote their proliferation. Finally, we show that the EGFR pathway contributes to gut morphogenesis through its activity in enterocytes and is required to properly coordinate the delamination and anoikis of damaged cells. This function of the EGFR pathway in enterocytes is key to maintaining homeostasis, as flies lacking EGFR are highly susceptible to infection. This study demonstrates that restoration of normal gut morphology following bacterial infection is a more complex phenomenon than previously described. Maintenance of gut homeostasis requires the coordination of stem cell proliferation and differentiation, with the incorporation and morphogenesis of new cells and the expulsion of damaged enterocytes. We show that one signaling pathway, the EGFR pathway, is central to all these stages, and its activation at multiple steps could synchronize the complex cellular events leading to gut repair and homeostasis.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36965619', 'title': 'The Wnt pathway protein Dvl1 targets somatostatin receptor 2 for lysosome-dependent degradation.', 'abstract': 'The Somatostatin receptor 2 (Sstr2) is a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor that is highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and is a common pharmacological target for intervention. Unfortunately, not all neuroendocrine tumors express Sstr2, and Sstr2 expression can be downregulated with prolonged agonist use. Sstr2 is rapidly internalized following agonist stimulation and, in the short term, is quantitatively recycled back to the plasma membrane. However, mechanisms controlling steady state expression of Sstr2 in the absence of agonist are less well described. Here, we show that Sstr2 interacts with the Wnt pathway protein Dvl1 in a ligand-independent manner to target Sstr2 for lysosomal degradation. Interaction of Sstr2 with Dvl1 does not affect receptor internalization, recycling, or signaling to adenylyl cyclase but does suppress agonist-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Importantly, Dvl1-dependent degradation of Sstr2 can be stimulated by overexpression of Wnts and treatment of cells with Wnt pathway inhibitors can boost Sstr2 expression in neuroendocrine tumor cells. Taken together, this study identifies for the first time a mechanism that targets Sstr2 for lysosomal degradation that is independent of Sstr2 agonist and can be potentiated by Wnt ligand. Intervention in this signaling mechanism has the potential to elevate Sstr2 expression in neuroendocrine tumors and enhance Sstr2-directed therapies.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39833633', 'title': 'Recent advances in the role of gasotransmitters in necroptosis.', 'abstract': 'Necroptosis is a finely regulated programmed cell death process involving complex molecular mechanisms and signal transduction networks.

In recent years, gasotransmitters such as nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide have been suggested to play a regulatory role in necroptosis.

We previously demonstrated, however, that p42/p44 MAP kinase, a critical effector for cell proliferation, does not colocalize with RTKs in caveolae of quiescent airway myocytes. Therefore, we investigated the subcellular sites of growth factor-induced MAP kinase activation. In quiescent myocytes, though epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was almost exclusively found in caveolae, p42/p44 MAP kinase, Grb2, and Raf-1 were absent from these membrane domains. EGF induced concomitant phosphorylation of caveolin-1 and p42/p44 MAP kinase; however, EGF did not promote the localization of p42/p44 MAP kinase, Grb2, or Raf-1 to caveolae. Interestingly, stimulation of muscarinic M(2) and M(3) receptors that were enriched in caveolae-deficient membranes also induced p42/p44 MAP kinase phosphorylation, but this occurred in the absence of caveolin-1 phosphorylation. This suggests that the localization of receptors to caveolae and interaction with caveolin-1 is not directly required for p42/p44 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that EGF exposure induced rapid translocation of EGFR from caveolae to caveolae-free membranes. EGFR trafficking coincided temporally with EGFR and p42/p44 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Collectively, this indicates that although caveolae sequester some receptors associated with p42/p44 MAP kinase activation, the site of its activation is associated with caveolae-free membrane domains.

Replacing Intersectin's regulatory domains with the BH3 peptide/Bcl-xL binding module generated a panel of synthetic GEF constructs that can be activated with a competitive ligand. Importantly, the nucleotide exchange activities of these synthetic Intersectin constructs can be controlled in a rapid and dose-dependent manner. The modular nature of this strategy should make it useful for engineering other enzymes involved in signal transduction.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37632647', 'title': \"A high affinity and specificity anti-HER2 single-domain antibody (VHH) that targets trastuzumab's epitope with versatile biochemical, biological, and medical applications.\", 'abstract': 'In the past decade, various single-domain antibodies from llamas, also known as VHH or nanobody, have been discovered with applications in tumor imaging and cancer therapy.

First, the ADMETlab2.0 and ADMETsar databases, along with literature, predicted Thiabendazole's potential to induce cancer and liver damage. Disease target libraries were constructed using GeneCards and TCMIP databases, while Thiabendazole target libraries were constructed using Swiss Target Prediction and TCMIP databases.

Molecular docking assessed the binding affinity between Thiabendazole and core targets. The study revealed 29 potential targets for Thiabendazole-induced cancer and 30 potential targets for liver injury. PPI identified 5 core targets for Thiabendazole-induced cancers and 4 core targets for induced liver injury. KEGG analysis indicated that Thiabendazole might induce gastric and prostate cancer via cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targets, and liver injury through the same targets, with the p53 signaling pathway being central.

We also used the BrainSpan transcriptomic dataset of the developing human brain to examine whether GPCRs that exhibit chronological age-associated expressions have a higher tendency to be dysregulated in psychiatric disorders than age-independent GPCRs. We found that most GPCR genes were differentially expressed in the four disorders and that the GPCR superfamily as a gene cluster was overrepresented in the four disorders.

Neuropathological hallmarks comprise abnormal cortical layering and enlarged, dysmorphic neuronal elements. Fundamentally altered local neuronal activity has been reported in human FCD type 2 epilepsy surgical biopsies. Of note, FCD type 2 emerges during brain development and forms complex connectivity architectures with surrounding neuronal networks. Local cortical microcircuits, particularly in frontal localization, are extensively modulated by monoaminergic axonal projections originating from the brainstem. Previous analysis of monoaminergic modulatory inputs in human FCD type 2 biopsies suggested altered density and distribution of these monoaminergic axons; however, a systematic investigation is still pending. Here, we perform a comprehensive analysis of dopaminergic (DA) innervation, in human FCD type 2 biopsies and in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of an FCD type 2 mouse model [mechanistic target of rapamyin (mTOR) hyperactivation model] during adolescent and adult stages. In addition, we analyse the expression of dopamine receptor transcripts via multiplex fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization in human specimens and the mPFC of this mouse model. In the mTOR hyperactivation mouse model, we observe a transient alteration of DA innervation density during adolescence and a trend towards decreased innervation in adulthood. In human FCD type 2 areas, the overall DA innervation density is decreased in adult patients compared with control areas from these patients. Moreover, the DA innervation shows an altered lamination pattern in the FCD type 2 area compared with the control area. Dopamine receptors 1 and 2 appear to be differentially expressed in the dysmorphic neurons in human samples and mTOR-mutant cells in mice compared with normally developed neurons. Intriguingly, our results suggest complex molecular and structural alterations putatively inducing impaired DA neurotransmission in FCD type 2.

Their interaction with GPCRs activates intracellular signalling cascades, such as the cAMP/PKA pathway, which plays a crucial role in ovarian follicle development and luteinisation. These interactions may enhance reproductive performance by improving fertility, synchronising estrous cycles, and promoting ovulation. Phytoestrogens also influence the regularity and timing of the estrous cycle, offering potential applications in estrous synchronisation and reproductive management. In this study, molecular docking was conducted on 12,000 phytochemicals to identify potential GPCR ligands. From this extensive screening, five compounds with the highest binding affinities to GPCRs were selected. Notably, Genistein and Apigenin emerged as top candidates, with docking scores (-8.58\\u2009kcal/mol and -8.27\\u2009kcal/mol) and lower RMSD values (0.69 and 1.30) compared to synthetic GPCR agonists such as Estradiol (-6.07\\u2009kcal/mol and 1.02), respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) confirmed the stability of these phytoestrogen -GPCR complexes, suggesting effective and sustained interactions. The screened phytoestrogens demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic profiles, including non-toxicity, non-carcinogenicity, and high gastrointestinal absorption, positioning them as viable candidates for enhancing reproductive performance in dairy cattle through GPCR modulation.

Therefore, these receptors require ligand-triggered domain rearrangements rather than receptor dimerization for activation. Specifically, binding of peptide ligands to receptor ectodomains transduces signals across the transmembrane domains for trans-autophosphorylation in cytoplasmic kinase domains. The molecular details of these processes are poorly understood in part due to the absence of structures of full-length receptors. Using MD simulations and enhanced conformational sampling algorithms, we present all-atom structural models of peptides containing 51 residues from the transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions of IR and IGF1R. In our models, the transmembrane regions of both receptors adopt helical conformations with kinks at Pro961 (IR) and Pro941 (IGF1R), but the C-terminal residues corresponding to the juxtamembrane region of each receptor adopt unfolded and flexible conformations in IR as opposed to a helix in IGF1R. We also observe that the N-terminal residues in IR form a kinked-helix sitting at the membrane-solvent interface, while homologous residues in IGF1R are unfolded and flexible. These conformational differences result in a larger tilt-angle of the membrane-embedded helix in IGF1R in comparison to IR to compensate for interactions with water molecules at the membrane-solvent interfaces. Our metastable/stable states for the transmembrane domain of IR, observed in a lipid bilayer, are consistent with a known NMR structure of this domain determined in detergent micelles, and similar states in IGF1R are consistent with a previously reported model of the dimerized transmembrane domains of IGF1R.

Culture of MEPM cells in the presence of bFGF, IGF-II or TGF-beta 1 induced changes in 125I-EGF binding. TGF-beta 1 caused a marked reduction in binding to 40% of control levels. This reduction was achieved after 2 h and persisted for 24 h after addition of the growth factor. IGF-II induced a similar reduction but this effect was transitory; after a 12 h pretreatment with IGF-II, binding was restored to control levels. The effects of bFGF were biphasic. Initially, a short pre-treatment period (3-5 h) with bFGF caused a small reduction in 125I-EGF binding; longer periods of pre-incubation (24 h) resulted in a large increase in receptor number. Pre-incubation in medium containing both bFGF and TGF-beta 1 resulted in a decrease in EGF binding. Thus, TGF-beta 1 negated the large increase in receptor number induced by bFGF alone.

Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling activation triggers IMPDH2-Ser122 dephosphorylation mediated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which is dependent on FGFR3-mediated PPP2R1A-Tyr261 phosphorylation leading to PPP2CA-PPP2R1A-IMPDH2 interactions. In turn, Ser122 dephosphorylation positively modulates IMPDH2 activity and contributes to guanine nucleotide synthesis and purine homeostasis, thereby facilitating S-phase completion and cell proliferation. Accordingly, IMPDH2 dephosphorylation is implicated in FGFR activation-enhanced tumorigenesis, and the low level of IMPDH2-Ser122 phosphorylation predicts the poor prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer.

In this study, it demonstrates that USP22 increases the secretion of tumor cell-derived EVs and accelerates their migration and invasion, invadopodia formation, and angiogenesis via EV transfer. USP22 enhances EV secretion by upregulating myosin IB (MYO1B). This study further discovers that USP22 activated the SRC signaling pathway by upregulating the molecule KDEL endoplasmic reticulum protein retention receptor 1 (KDELR1), thereby contributing to LUAD cell progression. The study provides novel insights into the role of USP22 in EV secretion and cell motility regulation in LUAD.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32790346', 'title': 'Glycan-Modified Virus-like Particles Evoke T Helper Type 1-like Immune Responses.', 'abstract': 'Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly effective antigen-presenting cells that shape immune responses.

The damage induced by alcohol depends on the amount, time, and consumption patterns (continuous and heavy episodic drinking). It affects individual global well-being and social and familial environments with variable impact. Alcohol addiction manifests with different degrees of organ and mental health detriment for the individual, exhibiting two main traits: compulsive drinking and negative emotional states occurring at withdrawal, frequently causing relapse episodes. Numerous individual and living conditions, including the concomitant use of other psychoactive substances, lie in the complexity of AUD. Ethanol and its metabolites directly impact the tissues and may cause local damage or alter the homeostasis of brain neurotransmission, immunity scaffolding, or cell repair biochemical pathways. Brain modulator and neurotransmitter-assembled neurocircuitries govern reward, reinforcement, social interaction, and consumption of alcohol behaviors in an intertwined manner. Experimental evidence supports the participation of neurotensin (NT) in preclinical models of alcohol addiction. For example, NT neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala projecting to the parabrachial nucleus strengthen alcohol consumption and preference. In addition, the levels of NT in the frontal cortex were found to be lower in rats bred to prefer alcohol to water in a free alcohol-water choice compared to wild-type animals. NT receptors 1 and 2 seem to be involved in alcohol consumption and alcohol effects in several models of knockout mice. This review aims to present an updated picture of the role of NT systems in alcohol addiction and the possible use of nonpeptide ligands modulating the activity of the NT system, applied to experimental animal models of harmful drinking behavior mimicking alcohol addiction leading to health ruin in humans.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39203448', 'title': 'Probiotics in miRNA-Mediated Regulation of Intestinal Immune Homeostasis in Pigs: A Physiological Narrative.', 'abstract': \"The microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining the host's intestinal homeostasis, influencing numerous physiological functions. Various factors, including diet, stress, and antibiotic use, can lead to such imbalances. Probiotics have been shown to restore the microbiota, contributing to maintaining this balance. For instance, the weaning stage in piglets is crucial; this transition can cause unfavorable changes that may contribute to the onset of diarrhea. Probiotic supplementation has increased due to its benefits. However, its mechanism of action is still controversial; one involves the regulation of intestinal immunity. When recognized by immune system cells through membrane receptors, probiotics activate intracellular signaling pathways that lead to changes in gene expression, resulting in an anti-inflammatory response. This complex regulatory system involves transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, including the modulation of various molecules, emphasizing microRNAs. They have emerged as important regulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. Analyzing these mechanisms can enhance our understanding of probiotic-host microbiota interactions, providing insights into their molecular functions.

As stratification algorithms comprising the parameters of individual tumor biology are missing, the identification of ideal patients for extensive tumor surgery is often challenging. The CXC chemokine family exerts decisive functions in cell-cell interactions and has only recently been associated with cancer, but little is known about their function in BTC. Here, we aim to evaluate a potential role of circulating CXCL1, CXCL10 and CXCL13 in patients with resectable BTC. Serum levels of CXCL1, CXCL10 and CXCL13 were measured by multiplex immunoassay in a cohort of 119 BTC patients undergoing tumor resection and 50 control samples. Circulating levels of CXCL1, CXCL10 and CXCL13 were all significantly elevated in BTC patients compared to healthy controls and increased the diagnostic power of established tumor markers such as CA19-9 when used in combination. Importantly, elevated levels of CXCL13 both before and after tumor resection identified a subgroup of patients with significantly impaired outcomes following tumor resection. As such, BTC patients with initial CXCL13 levels above the ideal prognostic cut-off value (25.01 pg/mL) had a median overall survival (OS) of 290 days compared to 969 days for patients with low initial CXCL13 levels. The prognostic value of circulating CXCL13 was further confirmed by uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses.

Accessory cells supported the induction of CD25 expression as well as of proliferative responses after anti-CD3 cross-linking and prevented the induction of anergy in CD4+ CD28- T cell clones. In contrast to CD4+CD28+ T cells, the presence of accessory cells did not enhance the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-gamma, or IL-4.

The balance between these two antagonizing RBPJ-complexes depends on the activation state of the Notch receptor regulated by cell-to-cell interaction, ligand binding and proteolytic cleavage events. Here, we depleted RBPJ in mature T-cells lacking active Notch signaling and performed RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq and ATAC-seq analyses. RBPJ depletion leads to upregulation of many Notch target genes. Ectopic expression of NICD1 activates several Notch target genes and enhances RBPJ occupancy. Based on gene expression changes and RBPJ occupancy we define four different clusters, either RBPJ- and/or Notch-regulated genes. Importantly, we identify early (Hes1 and Hey1) and late Notch-responsive genes (IL2ra). Similarly, to RBPJ depletion, interfering with transcriptional repression by squelching with cofactor KYOT2/FHL1, leads to upregulation of Notch target genes.

Yet, their effectiveness is limited by the fixed electron concentration dictated by the metal composition and inefficient hot spot creation due to the large mode volume.

This study investigates the potential of close-packed ITO NC monolayers for surface-enhanced infrared absorption by quantifying trends in the coupling between their plasmon modes and various molecular vibrations. We show that maximum vibrational signal intensity occurs in monolayers composed of larger, more highly doped NCs, where the plasmon resonance peak lies at higher frequency than the molecular vibration.

Reduction of HLH-2 function by RNAi or with a hypomorphic allele causes defects in AC invasion. Genetic analysis indicates that HLH-2 has functions outside of the FOS-1A pathway. Using expression analysis, we identify three genes that are transcriptionally regulated by HLH-2: the protocadherin cdh-3, and two genes encoding secreted extracellular matrix proteins, mig-6/papilin and him-4/hemicentin. Further, we show that reduction of HLH-2 function causes defects in polarization of F-actin to the invasive cell membrane, a process required for the AC to generate protrusions that breach the basement membrane. This work identifies HLH-2 as a regulator of the invasive phenotype in the AC, adding to our understanding of the transcriptional networks that control cell invasion.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11076767', 'title': 'Papilin in development; a pericellular protein with a homology to the ADAMTS metalloproteinases.', 'abstract': \"Papilin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that we have found to be involved in, (1) thin matrix layers during gastrulation, (2) matrix associated with wandering, phagocytic hemocytes, (3) basement membranes and (4) space-filling matrix during Drosophila development.

A distinctly conserved 'papilin cassette' of domains at the amino-end of papilins is also the carboxyl-end of the ADAMTS subgroup of secreted, matrix-associated metalloproteinases; this cassette contains one thrombospondin type 1 (TSR) domain, a specific cysteine-rich domain and several partial TSR domains. In vitro, papilin non-competitively inhibits procollagen N-proteinase, an ADAMTS metalloproteinase. Inhibiting papilin synthesis in Drosophila or Caenorhabditis causes defective cell arrangements and embryonic death. Ectopic expression of papilin in Drosophila causes lethal abnormalities in muscle, Malpighian tubule and trachea formation.

Affinity purified antibodies against this protein localized it primarily to the basement membranes of embryos. The antibodies cross-reacted with another material which was not sulfated and appeared to be the core protein of papilin, which is proteoglycan-like. After reduction, papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000. The core protein was formed by some cell lines and by other cells on incubation with 1 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl xyloside, which inhibited formation of the proteoglycan-like form. The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures. The protein contains 22% combined serine and threonine residues and 25% combined aspartic and glutamic residues. 10 g of polypeptide has attached 6.4 g of glucosamine, 3.1 g of galactosamine, 6.1 g of uronic acid, and 2.7 g of neutral sugars. There are about 80 O-linked carbohydrate chains/core protein molecule. Sulfate is attached to these chains. The O-linkage is through an unidentified neutral sugar. Papilin is largely resistant to common glycosidases and several proteases. The degree of sulfation varies with the sulfate concentration of the incubation medium. This proteoglycan-like glycoprotein differs substantially from corresponding proteoglycans found in vertebrate basement membranes, in contrast to Drosophila basement membrane laminin and collagen IV which have been conserved evolutionarily.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19724244', 'title': 'Genome-wide association study of suicidal ideation emerging during citalopram treatment of depressed outpatients.', 'abstract': \"Suicidal ideation is an uncommon but worrisome symptom than can emerge during antidepressant treatment.

As the new method produces LAMP amplicon containing two DNAzyme molecules per amplification unit, the method was termed colorimetric Dual DNAzyme LAMP (cDDLAMP). cDDLAMP was developed targeting 3 common STEC's virulence genes (stx1, stx2, and eae) that are associated with serious human illnesses such hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Immunomagnetic enrichment was used for specific, ultrasensitive, and fast detection of STEC in food samples (leafy vegetables and milk).

No cross-reaction with other generic E. coli strains and non-E. coli bacteria was observed.

This study aims to investigate the association between GV and short- and long-term all-cause mortality. Clinical data for hemorrhagic stroke (HS) patients were obtained from the MIMIC-IV 3.1 database. GV was quantified using the coefficient of variation (CV), calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean blood glucose level. The association between GV and clinical outcomes was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were employed to examine the nonlinear relationship between GV and short- and long-term all-cause mortality. A total of 2,240 ICU patients with HS were included in this study. In fully adjusted models, RCS analyses revealed a U-shaped association between the CV and both short- and long-term all-cause mortality (P for nonlinearity < 0.001 for all outcomes). Two-piecewise Cox regression models were subsequently applied to identify CV thresholds. The thresholds for all-cause mortality in ICU, during hospitalization, and at 30, 90, and 180 days were determined to be 0.14, 0.16, 0.155, 0.14, and 0.14, respectively.

Two systemic proteins were significantly higher in those with a prior stroke: CCL14 and FGF-19. Multiple logistic regression found higher levels of CCL14 and FGF-19 to be predictive of a stroke being recurrent. Along with other demographics, these proteins could provide a predictive model to identify patients with risk of recurrent ischemic strokes. Serum CCL14 and FGF-19 levels are easily accessible biomarkers, making them possible therapeutic targets for recurrent stroke prevention.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40265594', 'title': 'Impact of fecal microbiota transplantation on lung function and gut microbiome in an ARDS rat model: A multi-omics analysis including 16S rRNA sequencing, metabolomics, and transcriptomics.', 'abstract': 'Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe pulmonary condition characterized by inflammation and lung damage, frequently resulting in poor clinical outcomes.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the impact of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes involved in vitamin D metabolism (VDR, GC, CYP27B1, CYP2R1, and CYP24A1) on the risk of developing CVDs.

It is characterized by cognitive deficits associated with the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Huang-Lian-Jie-Du (HLJD) decoction, recognized as a representative formulation with heat-clearing and detoxification effects, has been demonstrated to be effective in treating AD. However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation. 5xFAD mice were administrated low and high doses of HLJD. The Morris water maze test was conducted to assess the effects of HLJD. Aβ42 and total tau protein levels were evaluated. Additionally, network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify therapeutic targets of HLJD's active components and their relevance to AD. ELISA, qPCR, Western Blot, and immunofluorescence assays were employed to confirm the identified pathways. Finally, primary microglia isolated from 5xFAD mice were used to validate the candidate targets of HLJD. HLJD improved cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice and reduced amyloid plaque deposition and tau protein levels. Network pharmacology analysis indicated that HLJD influences the neuroinflammatory response, particularly through the Dap12 signaling pathway. This was confirmed by reduced levels of neuroinflammation markers, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and indicators of microglial activation and polarization. The expression of Trem2 and Dap12 in the hippocampus (HIP) of 5xFAD mice, as well as in the isolated primary microglia, were downregulated following HLJD treatment.

The indiscriminate use of acaricides stimulates the selection of resistant tick populations and is therefore ineffective. Understanding the molecular foundations of resistance could help inform the search for new alternatives for tick control. Although the ovary has been suggested as a relevant target organ for tick control, there are few existing studies that focus on tick ovarian tissue. Therefore, we conducted a comparative proteomic analysis on ovaries of R. microplus strains with differential resistance to ivermectin. In resistant ticks, we observed the over-accumulation of proteins involved in several biological processes, including translation, proteolysis, transport, cellular organization, differentiation, and xenobiotic detoxification. We also observed the accumulation of many structural and extracellular proteins such as papilin-like protein, which glycosylation increase its stability-based molecular modeling. Therefore, we propose that ovaries of ivermectin-resistant ticks overcome the negative impact of ivermectin through the activation of detoxification mechanisms and structural proteins associated with the remodeling of the ovary's extracellular matrix. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the molecular foundation of ivermectin resistance in Rhipicephalus microplus represents an essential step in cattle farming, which could provide clues and alternatives for tick control. Excessive use of chemicals like ivermectin allows the generation of resistant tick strains in different countries. However, limited molecular information is available concerning the tick's resistance to ivermectin. Detailed proteomics scrutiny in various tick organs will provide more comprehensive molecular information. Thus, we conducted an ovary comparative proteomic-based TMT-SPS-MS3 approach.

During plant-pathogen interactions, both organisms have evolved mechanisms to regulate protease activity. Plants produce specific inhibitors to prevent excessive or harmful proteolysis, while pathogens counteract these defenses by deploying molecules that block proteases and weaken plant immunity. Despite significant progress in understanding protease function, many regulatory mechanisms remain unexplored. This review examines the roles of endoproteases in plant responses to biotic stress and the diverse strategies employed by both plants and pathogens to modulate their activity. We discuss known protease inhibition mechanisms and highlight emerging methodologies that offer new insights into protease regulation. Additionally, we explore biotechnological applications, including genetic engineering and chemical inhibitors, aimed at enhancing plant resistance to pathogens. By integrating current knowledge with innovative research tools, we can uncover novel protease regulatory pathways and develop new strategies to improve plant resilience. Understanding these mechanisms not only advances fundamental plant biology but also holds potential for sustainable agricultural practices in the face of evolving pathogen threats.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40244438', 'title': 'RAGE deficiency ameliorates abdominal aortic aneurysm progression.', 'abstract': 'Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a vascular disease characterized by inflammation and arterial wall degradation.

Oil production of these plants under controlled conditions is promising; however, their performance under field-like conditions with abiotic stresses remains uncertain. In this study, wild-type (WT) and high-leaf oil (HLO) transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants were exposed to moderate and sustained water stress to mimic field conditions. The effects of water stress on biomass and lipid accumulation were investigated at the physiological, biochemical, and transcriptional levels. The presence of transgenes increased leaf triacylglycerol (TAG) levels in HLO plants by upregulating endogenous genes involved in lipid biosynthesis at the expense of biomass reduction, altered leaf lipid content and profile, and a decrease in unsaturation levels of membrane lipids compared to WT plants. Moreover, the biomass penalty in HLO plants could reduce canopy transpiration, contributing to their better performance under water-limited environments. Furthermore, WT and HLO plants exhibited enhanced TAG accumulation under water stress but via different mechanisms. In WT plants, water stress induced lipid remodeling, upregulated genes encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP), diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase (DGAT2), and lipid droplet-associated proteins (LDAP1), but downregulated genes encoding Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu (GDSL) lipases. In contrast, HLO plants showed increased TAG accumulation primarily through upregulation of OLEOSINS and downregulation of GDSLs under water stress. In conclusion, moderate water stress promoted oil production in HLO plants, demonstrating the robustness of HLO technology for sustainable oil production in the field under water deficit conditions which may be more prevalent in the future due to climate change.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40241101', 'title': 'The ability of anexelekto (AXL) expression and TERT promoter mutation to predict radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma.', 'abstract': 'Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) generally has a favourable prognosis with standard treatments; however, the risks of local recurrence and distant metastases remain a concern, affecting a substantial proportion of patients.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 81 DTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy and received at least two courses of RAI therapy. After a median follow-up period of 30 months (range: 6-60 months), therapy response was categorized as nonrefractory or refractory. AXL expression and TERT promoter mutation were evaluated in all patients to discern any associations with the development of RAI refractoriness. The overall prevalence of refractory RAI in DTC patients was 44.4% (36/81).

Hence, this study aimed to explore the function and corresponding mechanisms of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide A (SNRPA), a vital RNAs splicing molecule, in HCC. Here, the University of Alabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis portal (UALCAN), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry indicated that SNRPA levels were elevated in HCC tissues. Moreover, high expression of SNRPA was correlated with unfavorable clinicopathologic features and poor survival in HCC patients. A series of in vitro and in vivo gain/loss-of-function experiments reported that SNRPA promoted the proliferation of HCC cells. Integrated nanopore full-length cDNA sequencing and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that B7 homologue 6 (B7-H6) was a potential target of SNRPA. Subsequently, western blotting and flow cytometry showed that SNRPA activated B7-H6-STAT3/AKT signaling axis in HCC cells with promotion of G1-S transition in the cell cycle and inhibition of cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation and polymerase chain reaction with using exon-exon and exon-intron junction primers revealed that SNRPA facilitated B7-H6 pre-mRNA maturation by binding to it directly and contributing to its intron 2 splicing. Moreover, drug sensitivity test found that SNRPA induced HCC cell resistance to lenvatinib. Finally, restoration experiments demonstrated that the effects of SNRPA on HCC cells relied on B7- H6 expression. Taken together, SNRPA promotes HCC growth and lenvatinib resistance via B7-H6-STAT3/AKT axis through facilitating B7-H6 pre-mRNA maturation by maintaining its intron 2 splicing.

This study explored the kinetics of the innate and adaptive immune responses in chickens exposed to virulent Newcastle Disease Virus (vNDV) genotype VII. A challenge experiment was carried out with both non-vaccinated and NDV-vaccinated chickens utilizing different vaccination strategies commonly used in the industry. The four groups of vaccinated birds were administered either two doses of live NDV vaccines, live vaccines boosted with an inactivated vaccine, the rHVT-NDV-IBDV vaccine alone, or the rHVT-NDV-IBDV vaccine in conjunction with a live vaccine booster. To assess seven cytokines linked to antiviral and proinflammatory innate responses quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were implemented. The analyses revealed robust innate immune responses in all cytokines measured in lung and spleen tissues of the group that received both live and inactivated vaccines. Notably these increases were found to correlate with the humoral immune response within that same group.

However, the literature on their utility in megaprostheses is limited. Our study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance and accuracy of four laboratory tests for diagnosing PJI in patients who have megaprostheses. We retrospectively reviewed 104 patients who underwent 126 revisions after oncologic megaprosthesis reconstruction. Revisions were stratified into aseptic and septic according to the International Consensus Meeting criteria. The PJIs were classified into acute and chronic infections based on time since index surgery. There were four tests assessed: serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), synovial white blood cell (WBC) count, and polymorphonuclear percentage (PMN%). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to assess their performance. The diagnostic performance of preoperative tests in acute PJIs ranked by area under the curve (AUC) was CRP (0.86), ESR (0.81), synovial WBC count (0.76), and synovial PMN% (0.69). In chronic PJIs, diagnostic performance ranked by AUC was synovial WBC count (0.80), CRP (0.77), ESR (0.71), and synovial PMN% (0.67). New cutoff values for diagnosing acute PJIs were identified as CRP ≥ 42 mg/L, synovial WBC count ≥ 5,500 cells/μL, and synovial PMN% ≥ 92.5%. For chronic PJIs, new cutoff values of CRP ≥ 31 mg/L, ESR ≥ 24.5 mm/hour, synovial WBC count ≥ 5,550 cells/μL, and synovial PMN% ≥ 76.5% were established.

It addresses a significant knowledge gap in the study of both degenerated and non-degenerated supraspinatus (SSp) tendons.

Inflammation and complex metabolic changes may play roles in its etiology. Evaluation of the metabolomic differences between the degenerated and non-degenerated SSp tissues of RCT patients was aimed. A cross-sectional study of 14 patients with RCTs, diagnosed through physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging, was conducted. Degenerate and non-degenerate SSp tissue debris were collected during arthroscopy. Untargeted metabolomic analysis of these samples was performed using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-ToF-MS). Metabolic peaks were identified, matched, and normalized before further analysis. Partial least squaresdiscriminant analysis (PLS-DA), heatmap generation, unsupervised volcano plots, and fold-change analyses were conducted. A putative metabolite list was subsequently compiled to elucidate pathways of degeneration. These metabolites were matched with metabolic pathways using the RaMP-DB metabolite set library. The tyrosine metabolism (p=4.93 x10-4), ferroptosis (p=1.25 x10-3), steroidogenesis (p=9.89 x10-4), and cholesterol biosynthesis (p=3.05 x10-3) were altered in the degenerated RCTs. These findings suggest that metabolomic alterations may be associated with the development of RCTs, with changes in tyrosine metabolism, ferroptosis, and lipid metabolism potentially contributing to muscle degeneration and inflammation.

Migration and invasion experiments confirmed its inhibitory effects on OVHM cells, while flow cytometry analysis demonstrated Emd-D-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations elucidated that Emd-D functions as an inhibitor by directly binding to the glycolysis-related enzyme PFKFB4. This was corroborated by alterations in intracellular lactate and pyruvate levels, as well as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression. PFKFB4 overexpression experiments further supported the dependence of Emd-D on PFKFB4-mediated glycolysis and SRC3/mTORC1 pathway-associated apoptosis.

Reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis animal models upregulate FABP7 expression. This upregulation may contribute to the pro-inflammatory phenotype that astrocytes display during neurodegeneration and is detrimental for co-cultured neurons. Here, we explore how FABP7 expression modulates astrocyte response to inflammatory stimuli. Our results showed that silencing FABP7 expression in astrocyte cultures before treatment with different inflammatory stimuli decreases the expression of a luciferase reporter expressed under the control of NF-κB -response elements. Correspondingly, FABP7-silenced astrocytes display decreased nuclear translocation of the NF-κB-p65 subunit in response to these stimuli. Moreover, silencing FABP7 decreases the toxicity of stimulated astrocytes toward co-cultured motor neurons. Similar results were obtained after silencing FABP7 in human astrocytes differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells.

Receptor di/oligomers play roles in diverse facets of receptor function. Changes in receptor di/oligomers have been implicated in a range of diseases; therefore, better understanding of the specific composition and interactions between receptors in complexes is essential, especially for the development of di/oligomer-specific drugs. Previously, different optical microscopy approaches and proximity-based biophysical assays have been used to demonstrate di/oligomerization of membrane receptors. However, in recent years, single-molecule super-resolution microscopy techniques have allowed researchers to quantify and uncover the precise dynamics and stoichiometry of specific receptor complexes. This allows the organization of membrane protein receptors to be mapped across the plasma membrane to explore the effects of factors such as ligands, effectors, membrane environment, and therapeutic agents. Quantification of receptor complexes is required to better understand the intricate balance of distinct receptor complexes in cells. In this brief review, we provide an overview of single-molecule approaches for the quantification of receptor di/oligomerization. We will discuss the techniques commonly employed to study membrane receptor di/oligomerization and their relative advantages and limitations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Receptor di/oligomerization plays an important role in their function. For some receptors, di/oligomerization is essential for functional signaling, whereas for others, it acts as a mechanism to achieve signaling pleiotropy. Aberrant receptor di/oligomerization has been implicated in a wide range of diseases. Single-molecule super-resolution microscopy techniques provide convincing methods to precisely quantify receptor complexes at the plasma membrane.

Research trends, collaboration networks, and key themes were visualized with VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the R package 'bibliometrix'. The analysis included 332 publications by 2,797 researchers across 50 countries. A notable increase in studies occurred after 2017, with China, the United States, and England as the top contributors. Key institutions included the University of Bristol and Nanjing Medical University. The most productive journals were Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention and International Journal of Epidemiology, while Nature Genetics was the most cited. The research identified multiple causal pathways for LC linked to inflammation, genetics, lifestyle factors, lung diseases, and psychiatric conditions. Emerging themes include the roles of gut microbiota, schizophrenia, C-reactive protein, and asthma in LC development. This bibliometric analysis of MR studies on LC highlights global research trends and emerging areas, particularly the roles of gut microbiota, schizophrenia, and inflammation in LC risk.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a critical crop for global food security, faces significant challenges from abiotic stresses. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), synthesized by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), plays a vital role in stress tolerance. Truncating the calmodulin-binding domain (CaMBD) in GAD enzymes enhances GAD activity and GABA production. In this study, we developed a hybrid line, Hybrid #78, by crossing two genome-edited lines, OsGAD1ΔC #5 and OsGAD3ΔC #8, with truncated CaMBD in OsGAD1 and OsGAD3, respectively. Hybrid #78 demonstrated significantly improved survival rates in cold (25%), salinity (33%), flooding (83%), and drought (83%) stress conditions, compared with wild-type Nipponbare (0-33%), OsGAD1∆C #5 (0-66%), and OsGAD3∆C #8 (0-50%). Hybrid #78 showed the highest GABA levels during stress, with increases of 3.5-fold (cold), 3.9-fold (salinity), 5-fold (flooding), and 5-fold (drought) relative to wild-type Nipponbare and up to 2-fold higher than that of the parent lines. RNA-seq analysis from shoot tissues in control conditions identified 975 differentially expressed genes between Hybrid #78 and wild-type Nipponbare, with 450 genes uniquely expressed in the hybrid. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment revealed that upregulation in nitrogen metabolism pathways likely contributes to enhanced GABA synthesis via increased glutamate production. Hybrid #78 also showed broader gene expression variability, suggesting enhanced adaptability to stress, especially upregulation of stress-related genes, such as OsDREB, OsHSP70, and OsNAC3.

They are generated under oxidative stress conditions, mediating important anti-inflammatory signaling activities through covalent modification of protein cysteine thiols. Despite being cytoprotective in benign tissue, nitroalkenes display single-agent anti-proliferative activity in breast cancer cells and sensitize them to multiple DNA-damaging agents. Initial mechanistic evidence suggested that nitroalkene anti-cancer activities are partially mediated by inhibition of homologous recombination (HR) through the recombinase RAD51 at Cys319. However, nitroalkenes are multi-target agents, and thus, it is likely that other important DNA repair targets beyond RAD51 are modified by nitroalkenes, contributing to their anti-cancer effects. We, therefore, conducted a global proteomics analysis to address this question. This analysis led to the identification of the recQ helicase RECQL4 with a nitro-alkylation at Cys1052. This modification was further confirmed by click chemistry-based chemoproteomics and determined to be DNA damage-dependent. Functional analyses demonstrated that nitroalkene modification inhibits RECQL4 ATP-dependent helicase activity and disrupts DSB end resection and downstream homology-dependent repair. Furthermore, experiments with C1052S mutant RECQL4 revealed that RECQL4 is a major mediator of nitroalkene effects on end resection, DSB formation, and repair.

Short-chain fatty acids were known to have immunomodulatory effects in neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. In this study, R6/2 mice were treated daily with 150 mM propionate. Survival range, body weight, and motor abilities were monitored. In striatal and cortical samples, neuronal survival was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining of NeuN-positive cells and expression levels of BDNF mRNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction. As inflammatory marker TNFα mRNA and IL-6 mRNA were quantified by rtPCR, iNOS-expressing cells were counted in immunologically stained brain slides. Microglial activation was evaluated by immunofluorescent staining of IBA1-positive cells and total IBA1 protein by Western Blot, in addition, SPI1 mRNA expression was quantified by rtPCR. Except for clasping behavior, propionate treatment did neither improve the clinical course nor mediated neuronal protection in R6/2 mice.

Although HD-Zip proteins are known regulators of stress responses, the functional roles of physic nut HD-Zip genes in drought adaptation remain uncharacterized. In this study, we functionally characterized JcHDZ25, a drought-inducible HD-Zip I gene from physic nut, which is predominantly expressed in roots and upregulated by ABA and drought. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activity assays confirmed that JcHDZ25 localized to the nucleus and exhibited intrinsic transcriptional activation. Transgenic rice overexpressing JcHDZ25 displayed enhanced drought tolerance and ABA sensitivity compared to wild-type plants. Under drought stress, JcHDZ25-overexpressing lines showed significantly higher proline content, elevated SOD and CAT activities, and reduced electrolyte leakage and MDA accumulation relative to wild-type controls. Furthermore, transgenic plants showed higher expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes (OsAPX2, OsCATA, OsLEA3, OsP5 CS, OsDREB2 A, OsADC1) and ABA pathway-related genes (OsNCED3, OsRD29 A) under drought stress compared to wild-type plants. JcHDZ25 positively regulates drought tolerance in rice possibly through an ABA-dependent transcriptional regulation, providing mechanistic insights into physic nut's drought adaptation and highlighting its potential as a genetic resource for engineering stress-resilient crops.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40266244', 'title': '', 'abstract': 'The '}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40273912', 'title': 'Encoding and decoding selectivity and promiscuity in the human chemokine-GPCR interaction network.', 'abstract': 'In humans, selective and promiscuous interactions between 46 secreted chemokine ligands and 23 cell surface chemokine receptors of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family form a complex network to coordinate cell migration.

The levels of HDAC6, ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5), embryonic lethal abnormal vision like 1 (ELAVL1), and fibrosis-related markers were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Cell proliferation and invasion were detected using cell counting kit 8 assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and Transwell assay. The contents of inflammatory factors were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the interaction between HDAC6 and RPS5 or ELAVL1. The effect of ELAVL1 knockdown on HDAC6 mRNA stability was evaluated using Actinomycin D treatment assay. HDAC6 showed increased expression in LC patients. The knockdown of HDAC6 reduced TGF-β1-induced LX-2 cell proliferation, invasion, fibrosis, and inflammation. Moreover, HDAC6 reduced the acetylation of RPS5, and RPS5 knockdown reversed the inhibition effect of si-HDAC6 on TGF-β1-induced LX-2 cell proliferation, invasion, fibrosis, and inflammation. Meanwhile, ELAVL1 interacted with HDAC6 to stabilize its mRNA, thus inhibiting RPS5 expression.

Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 play pivotal roles in mediating necroptosis, which can be triggered by the activation of specific death receptors and PRRs. In this study, we observed a reduction of RIPK1 protein after UVB exposure which led to activation of Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) in HaCaT cells. This activation, in turn, promoted the production of IL-1β and TNF-α. However, RIPK1 kinase remained inactive and did not participate in cell death. Interestingly, UVB radiation triggered the activation of RIPK3 independently of RIPK1 kinase activity and subsequently induced phosphorylation of mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), culminating in necroptosis and inflammation of the skin. At the same time, UVB-induced activation of RIPK3 also played a role in promoting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway of Keratinocytes. In conclusion, UVB irradiation initiates an inflammatory response via RIPK1 pathway without necessitating its enzymatic activity. Simultaneously, RIPK3 can be activated by UVB exposure independently of RIPK1's activity, resulting in necroptosis and inflammation of the skin.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40211184', 'title': 'Serum and synovial fluid levels of CSF-1 and in knee osteoarthritis and its clinical significance.', 'abstract': 'To investigate the serum and synovial fluid levels of CSF-1 in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and evaluate its clinical significance.

Experimental methods included RT-qPCR, siRNA transfection, luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. TKT was significantly upregulated in multiple cancers and correlated with immune cell infiltration, particularly in HCC. Elevated TKT expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) in HCC and was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05). Drug sensitivity analysis suggested that higher TKT expression was associated with reduced sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic agents, including sorafenib (p < 0.01). Furthermore, hypermethylation of the TKT promoter and low TKT expression were linked to improved OS in HCC (log-rank test p = 0.005). Single-cell analysis revealed that TKT was predominantly expressed in the monocyte/macrophage cluster associated with HCC, and pseudo-time series analysis highlighted TKT's role in cell differentiation within this cluster. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the close association between TKT and macrophage distribution in HCC. Moreover, STAT3 was found to directly regulate TKT expression by binding to its promoter region. Our findings suggest that TKT may play a role in tumor immunity and prognosis in HCC.

However, the exact mechanisms underlying lung cancer progression remain unclear. The tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor (TRAF) family members are cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, which function as both adaptor proteins and ubiquitin ligases to regulate diverse receptor signalings, leading to the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) signaling. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of TRAFs in different tissues and cancer types, as well as its mRNA expression, protein expression, prognostic significance and functional enrichment analysis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), in order to provide new strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. RNA sequencing data from the The Genotype-Tissue Expression database was used to analyze the expression patterns of TRAF family members in different human tissues. RNA sequencing data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database was used to analyze the expression patterns of TRAF family members in different types of cancer cell lines. RNA sequencing data from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to analyze the mRNA levels of TRAF family members across different types of human cancers. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses from HPA database were used to analyze the TRAF protein levels in NSCLC [lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC)]. Overall survival analysis was performed by Log-rank test using original data from Kaplan-Meier Plotter database to evaluate the correlation between TRAF expressions and prognosis. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the TRAF family-related genes using RNA sequencing data from the TCGA database for NSCLC. The correlation between the expression levels of TRAF family members and the tumor immune microenvironment was analyzed using the ESTIMATE algorithm based on RNA sequencing data from the TCGA database. The TRAF family members exhibited significant tissue-specific expression heterogeneity. TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF6 and TRAF7 were widely expressed in most tissues, while the expressions of TRAF1, TRAF4 and TRAF5 were restricted to specific tissues. The expressions of TRAF family members were highly specific among different types of cancer cell lines. In mRNA database of LUAD and LUSC, the expressions of TRAF2, TRAF4, TRAF5 and TRAF7 were significantly upregulated; while TRAF6 did the opposite; moveover, TRAF1 and TRAF3 only displayed a significant upregulation in LUAD and LUSC, respectively. Except for TRAF3, TRAF4 and TRAF7, other TRAF proteins displayed an obviously deeper IHC staining in LUAD and LUSC tissues compared with normal tissues. Additionally, patients with higher expression levels of TRAF2, TRAF4 and TRAF7 had shorter overall survival; while patients with higher expression levels of TRAF3, TRAF5 and TRAF6 had significantly longer overall survival; however, no significant difference had been observed between TRAF1 expression and the overall survival. TRAF family members differentially regulated multiple pathways, including NF-κB, immune response, cell adhesion and RNA splicing. The expression levels of TRAF family members were closely associated with immune cell infiltration and stromal cell content in the tumor immune microenvironment, with varying positive and negative correlations among different members. TRAF family members exhibit highly specific expression differences across different tissues and cancer types. Most TRAF proteins exhibit upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels in NSCLC, whereas, only upregulated expressions of TRAF2, TRAF4 and TRAF7 predict worse prognosis.

Proteolytic removal of mislocalized or defective membrane proteins is of critical importance for maintaining the homeostasis and integrity of the INM. Previous studies revealed that INM protein degradation depends on a specialized ubiquitin-proteasome system termed INM-Associated Degradation (INMAD) in plants, requiring the CDC48 complex and the 26S proteasome for membrane protein retrotranslocation and destruction, respectively. However, adaptor proteins that link membrane substrates to the CDC48/proteasome degradation machinery remain missing in the pathway. Here, we report the discovery of ECLIPSE, a previously uncharacterized protein that may serve as such a molecular bridge in the degradation of the conserved INM protein SUN1. We demonstrate that ECLIPSE physically associates with CDC48 and exhibits strong transcriptional co-regulation with multiple established plant INMAD components. Mechanistically, ECLIPSE may act as an adaptor through its dual-domain architecture: its C-terminal PUB domain mediates direct interaction with CDC48, while its N-terminal Ubiquitin-Associated domain recognizes ubiquitinated INM substrates. Genetic and biochemical analyses further established that ECLIPSE is required for SUN1 protein degradation in Arabidopsis, supporting its role in the turnover of at least some inner nuclear membrane proteins in plants.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40270304', 'title': 'Accurate Predictions of Molecular Properties of Proteins via Graph Neural Networks and Transfer Learning.', 'abstract': 'Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for predicting molecular properties of proteins, as it addresses limitations of experimental and traditional computational methods.

Dynamic and complex interactions between the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor cells critically influence the DNA damage response. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a multifunctional cytokine secreted at high levels in response to cellular damage and stress. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested that IL-33 plays a key role in promoting the therapeutic resistance of tumors. However, the actual source of IL-33 during cancer therapy and how IL-33 contributes to a resistant TME remain incompletely understood. In this study, we found that both cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor cells treated with DNA damage-inducing agents expressed and secreted high levels of IL-33, subsequently leading to enhanced DNA damage repair efficacy. Mechanistically, nuclear IL-33 primarily functions as a transcriptional co-activator of homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes, whereas the active form of IL-33 can drive the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway via the canonical IL-33/ST2 axis. Overall, we demonstrated that IL-33 plays a key role in mediating a DNA damage-resistant TME, which could represent a potential therapeutic vulnerability in chemoresistant cancer cells.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40242622', 'title': 'Association between C-reactive protein-albumin-lymphocyte index and stroke: an NHANES analysis (1999-2010).', 'abstract': 'This cross-sectional study is based on the NHANES (1999-2010) database and aims to explore the potential relationship between the CALLY index and stroke in the U.S. population. This cross-sectional study utilized data from NHANES (1999-2010), including 17,511 American participants after data cleaning. Laboratory markers related to the CALLY index were obtained through standardized biological sample collection and analysis procedures performed by trained professionals. Stroke status was determined based on self-reported questionnaires. Various statistical methods were employed to examine the association between the CALLY index and stroke, as well as its predictive efficacy for stroke risk, including multivariable logistic regression, subgroup analysis, RCS analysis, and ROC analysis. Among the 17,511 participants analyzed, our findings revealed a nonlinear L-shaped negative association between the CALLY index and stroke risk. In Model 3, a higher CALLY index was significantly associated with a lower stroke risk (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.98-0.99,  A reduced CALLY index may be linked to a higher risk of stroke.

The combination of a short lifespan and a declining neuroregenerative capacity upon aging makes it ideally suited for research on brain aging and regeneration. A remarkable cellular diversity makes up the young-adult killifish telencephalon, characterized by highly proliferative non-glial progenitors and spatially distinct radial glia subtypes. In contrast to a relatively slow embryonic development, hatching is followed by a period of accelerated growth, in which the brain experiences a period of rapid expansion and maturation. In this study, we quantified the growth progression and maturation of the killifish telencephalon during early post-embryonic development. We discovered that, similar to in zebrafish, neuro-epithelial cells abut the neurogenic niches from early life onwards. Spatial data revealed qualitative and quantitative differences along the anterior-posterior axis and between pallial and subpallial regions in terms of growth pace. We confirmed generation of GABAergic neurons from the subpallial neurogenic niche and glutamatergic neurons from two pallial niches. Our data further showed a more widespread appearance of inhibitory neurons at hatching compared to in zebrafish.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40272186', 'title': 'The influence of periodontal disease and periodontal treatment on colorectal cancer.', 'abstract': 'Periodontal disease (PD) is associated with more than 50 diseases and conditions, including colorectal cancer.

We compared the CRP levels between two groups: the group of subjects who underwent periodontal treatment and the patients who did not receive periodontal disease treatment. An attempt was made to isolate the periodontal pathogenic bacteria FN and PG from the mucosa of the cancerous tissue in the colon by using quantitative culture. We found no statistically significant difference between the groups in the initial CRP measurements before starting cancer treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the CRP measurements taken 1st and 2nd day after surgery and at the follow-up appointment.

Troy, previously identified as a reserve stem cell marker in adult gastric tissues, is examined across various developmental stages from birth to adulthood. We showed that Troy+ cells are scattered throughout the gastric gland in early postnatal stages, but they become concentrated in the basal portion of the gland as the rats mature. Additionally, early weaning affects Troy expression at its gene and protein levels, altering its distribution in the gastric mucosa. This suggests that early dietary changes may disrupt the organization and function of the secondary stem cell niche in the stomach, potentially impacting gastric gland homeostasis. We also used in silico analysis to compare the molecular functions of Troy+ zymogenic and parietal cells, finding distinct roles in proliferation and secretion. The results underscore the importance of Troy in gastric development and highlight the long-term impact of early weaning on gastric tissue organization and cell proliferation dynamics.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40272981', 'title': 'Metabolite-dependent m', 'abstract': 'Intramembranous ossification, a major bone development process, begins with the condensation of precursor cells through the timely structural adaption of extracellular matrix (ECM) catering to rapid cellular morphological changes.

This research endeavored to meticulously analyze tryptophan metabolic characteristics in colon cancer and forecast immunotherapy responses. This study analyzed colon cancer samples from a training cohort of 473 tumors and 41 normal tissues from TCGA, with validation in 902 cancer patients across multiple GEO datasets. Patients were stratified into subtypes through consistent clustering, and a tryptophan metabolic risk score model was constructed using the random forest algorithm. Based on these risk scores, patients were delineated into high and low-risk groups, and their clinicopathologic characteristics, immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, and signaling pathway disparities were examined. The Oncopredict algorithm facilitated the identification of sensitive chemotherapeutic agents, while the immune escape score was employed to evaluate the immunotherapy response across risk groups. Transcriptomic sequencing findings were corroborated by single-cell sequencing from Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. Two distinct subtypes of colon cancer patients emerged, exhibiting significant prognostic and immune cell infiltration differences. The high-risk group demonstrated a poorer prognosis (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), advanced clinical stage (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and elevated immunosuppressive cell expression (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Additionally, three chemotherapeutic drugs showed efficacy in the high-risk cohort, displaying a heightened immune escape potential (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and diminished response to immunotherapy. Single-cell sequencing validated the overexpression of tryptophan-related genes in epithelial cells. In conclusion, tryptophan metabolism significantly influences the colon cancer immune microenvironment, with high-risk patients experiencing adverse prognoses and potentially reduced efficacy of immunotherapy.'}]}]\n"
