We mapped 602 APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 152 were nuclear specific. Effect sizes at intronic apaQTLs are negatively correlated with eQTL effect sizes.

As a result, drugs targeting OAS1 in the future might provide more potential opportunities and flexibility for treating ED. In conclusion, our study identified OAS1 as a gene of interest in the context of ED via targeting fibroblasts through integrated MR and scRNA-Seq analyses.

The analysis conditions were designed to fit the requirements of both affinity LC and ESI-MS. The mobile phase composition was optimized to maintain the proteins studied in native conditions and enable sharp pH changes in order to mimic properly IgGs Fc domain/FcRn receptor interaction. Mobile phase components needed to be sufficiently volatile to achieve native MS analysis. MS data demonstrated the conservation of the pseudonative form of IgGs and allowed identification of the separated variants. Native FcRn affinity LC-ESI-MS was performed on a therapeutic mAb undergoing various oxidation stress. Native MS detection was used to determine the sample oxidation level. Lower retention was observed for mAbs oxidized variants compared to their intact counterparts indicating decreased affinities for the receptor. This methodology proved to be suitable to identify and quantify post-translational modifications at native protein level in order to correlate their influence on the binding to the FcRn receptor.

Multi-omics-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses have provided new ideas for identifying potential drug targets. We conducted summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis to evaluate therapeutic targets associated with SS by integrating DNA methylation, gene expression and protein quantitative trait loci (mQTL, eQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genetic associations with SS were derived from the FinnGen study (discovery) and the GWAS catalog (replication). Colocalization analyses were employed to determine whether two potentially relevant phenotypes share the same genetic factors in a given region. Moreover, to delve deeper into potential regulation among DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein abundance, we conducted MR analysis to explore the causal relationship between candidate gene methylation and expression, as well as between gene expression and protein abundance. Drug prediction and molecular docking were further employed to validate the pharmacological activity of the candidate drug targets. Upon integrating the multi-omics data, we identified three genes associated with SS risk: TNFAIP3, BTN3A1, and PLAU. The methylation of cg22068371 in BTN3A1 was positively associated with protein levels, consistent with the negative effect of cg22068371 methylation on the risk of SS. Additionally, positive correlations were observed between the gene methylation of PLAU (cg04939496) and expression, as well as between expression and protein levels. This consistency elucidates the promotional effects of PLAU on SS risk at the DNA methylation, gene expression, and protein levels. At the protein level, genetically predicted TNFAIP3 (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.56-3.92) was positively associated with SS risk, while BTN3A1 (OR 2.96E-03, 95% CI 2.63E-04-3.33E-02) was negatively associated with SS risk. Molecular docking showed stable binding for candidate drugs and target proteins. Our study reveals promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of SS, providing valuable insights into targeted therapy for SS.

Genetic instruments for the expression of antihypertensive drug target genes were identified using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in blood, which are associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP). Exposure was derived from existing eQTL data in blood from the eQTLGen consortium and in the brain from the PsychENCODE and subsequently replicated in GTEx V8 and BrainMeta V2. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the potential effect of different antihypertensive drug classes on AD using summary statistics from a meta-analysis (111,326 cases and 677,663 controls) and further replicated in FinnGen cohorts (9301 cases and 367,976 controls). The reverse causality detection, assessing horizontal pleiotropy, Bayesian co-localization, phenotype scanning, and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis were implemented to consolidate the MR findings further. A 1-standard deviation (SD) lower expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in blood was associated with a lower SBP of 3.92 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.69-5.15) mmHg but an increased risk of AD (odds ratio (OR), 2.46; 95% CI, 1.82-3.33). A similar direction of association was also observed between ACE expression in prefrontal cortex (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.10-1.28), frontal cortex (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27), cerebellum (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.17), cortex (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.28) and ACE protein levels in plasma (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.17) and AD risk. Colocalization supports these results. Similar results were found in external validation. We found no evidence for an association between genetically estimated blood pressure (BP) and AD risk. There findings suggest an adverse association of lower ACE messenger RNA and protein levels with an elevated risk of AD, irrespective of its BP-lowering effects. These findings warrant greater pharmacovigilance and further investigation into the effect of ACE inhibitors, particularly those that are centrally acting, on neurodegenerative symptoms in patients with AD.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318029', 'title': 'A Combined Proteomics and Mendelian Randomization Approach to Investigate the Effects of Aspirin-Targeted Proteins on Colorectal Cancer.', 'abstract': \"Evidence for aspirin's chemopreventative properties on colorectal cancer (CRC) is substantial, but its mechanism of action is not well-understood.

Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) from INTERVAL ( Altered expression was detected for 125/5886 proteins.

MCM6 and RRM2 are involved in DNA repair whereby reduced expression may lead to increased DNA aberrations and ultimately cancer cell death, whereas ARFIP2 is involved in actin cytoskeletal regulation, indicating a possible role in aspirin's reduction of metastasis. Our approach has shown how laboratory experiments and population-based approaches can combine to identify aspirin-targeted proteins possibly affecting CRC risk.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39085621', 'title': 'Decoding the genetic landscape of juvenile dermatomyositis: insights from phosphorylation-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms.', 'abstract': 'Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic susceptibility loci associated with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).

Upon analyzing we made sure that the proteins from the patatin family were excluded to ensure a better representation of the other proteins. We subsequently performed pQTL analyses for all other proteins with a sufficient representation in the population and established a relationship between proteins and 26 potato tuber quality traits (e.g. flesh colour, enzymatic discoloration) by co-localization on the genetic map and a direct correlation study of protein abundances and phenotypic traits. Over 1643 unique protein spots were detected in total over the two harvests. We were able to map pQTLs for over 300 different protein spots some of which co-localized with traits such as starch content and cold sweetening. pQTLs were observed on every chromosome although not evenly distributed over the chromosomes. The largest number of pQTLs was found for chromosome 8 and the lowest for chromosome number 10. For some 20 protein spots multiple QTLs were observed. From this analysis, hotspot areas for protein QTLs were identified on chromosomes three, five, eight and nine.

For replication, two-sample MR was conducted utilizing independent pQTL data from the deCODE study. Multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step MR were further conducted to investigate potential mediators. Two proteins (PCSK9 and AIDA) exhibited associations with HF in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and four proteins (PCSK9, SWAP70, NCF1, and RELT) were related with HF in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. Among these associations, strong evidence from subsequent analyses supported the positive relationship between genetically predicted PCSK9 levels and the risk of HF in the context of CHD. Notably, MVMR analysis revealed that CHD and LDL-C did not exert a complete mediating effect in this relationship. Moreover, two-step MR results yielded valuable insights into the potential mediating proportions of CHD or LDL-C in this relationship. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the association between PCSK9 and concomitant HF and CHD. This association is partly elucidated by the influence of CHD or LDL-C, underscoring the imperative for additional validation of this connection and a thorough exploration of the mechanisms through which PCSK9 directly impacts ischemic HF.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276799', 'title': 'Genome-Wide Identification of RNA Modifications for Spontaneous Coronary Aortic Dissection.', 'abstract': 'RNA modification plays important roles in many biological processes such as gene expression control.

Taste perception involves neurotransmitter signaling, including serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine. Disruptions in these pathways are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. The integration of olfactory and taste signals in flavor perception may impact brain health, evident in olfactory dysfunction as an early symptom in neurodegenerative conditions. Shared immune response and inflammatory pathways may contribute to the association between altered taste perception and conditions like neurodegeneration, present in Alzheimer's disease. This study consists of an exploration of expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL), utilizing whole-blood transcriptome profiles, of 28 taste perception genes, from a combined cohort of 475 African American subjects. This comprehensive dataset was subsequently intersected with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Finally, the investigation delved into assessing the association between eQTLs reported in GWAS of AD and the profiles of 741 proteins from the Olink Neurological Panel. The eQTL analysis unveiled 3,547 statistically significant SNP-Gene associations, involving 412 distinct SNPs that spanned all 28 taste genes. In 17 GWAS studies encompassing various traits, a total of 14 SNPs associated with 12 genes were identified, with three SNPs consistently linked to Alzheimer's disease across four GWAS studies. All three SNPs demonstrated significant associations with the down-regulation of TAS2R41, and two of them were additionally associated with the down-regulation of TAS2R60. In the subsequent pQTL analysis, two of the SNPs linked to TAS2R41 and TAS2R60 genes (rs117771145 and rs10228407) were correlated with the upregulation of two proteins, namely EPHB6 and ADGRB3.

Accordingly, we hypothesize that there exists a causal association between genetic variants of specific plasma proteins and MS through MR mechanisms, and that key therapeutic targets can be precisely identified by integrating multi-omics analytical approaches. In this study, we developed a comprehensive analytical framework aimed at identifying and validating potential therapeutic targets for MS. The framework commenced with a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing two large plasma protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) datasets. Building on this foundation, we performed Bayesian co-localization analysis of coding genes, followed by a full phenotype-wide association study (PheWAS) on the co-positive genes identified through both analytical methods. This approach allowed us to explore the functions of key genes and the mechanisms of co-morbidity associated with the disease. Subsequently, we integrated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to facilitate drug prediction and molecular docking studies. This study conducted a systematic analysis between two large plasma pQTLs datasets and MS. In the MR analysis, the MR analysis of Icelandic plasma pQTLs and MS identified 88 positive plasma proteins, while the MR analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs and MS identified 122 positive plasma proteins. By comparison, uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS) and glutathione S-transferase theta 2B (GSTT2B) were found to be the positive proteins shared by the two datasets.

PQTLs consistently replicated between the two cohorts. Features of pQTLs were compared to previously reported expression QTLs (eQTLs). Inference of causal relations of pQTL genotypes, biomarker measurements, and four clinical COPD phenotypes (airflow obstruction, emphysema, exacerbation history, and chronic bronchitis) were explored using conditional independence tests. We identified 527 highly significant (p < 8 X 10-10) pQTLs in 38 (43%) of blood proteins tested. Most pQTL SNPs were novel with low overlap to eQTL SNPs. The pQTL SNPs explained >10% of measured variation in 13 protein biomarkers, with a single SNP (rs7041; p = 10-392) explaining 71%-75% of the measured variation in vitamin D binding protein (gene = GC).

Most pQTLs were local (cis), but distant (trans) pQTL SNPs in the ABO blood group locus were the top pQTL SNPs for five proteins.

Genetic association data for RA were primarily derived from the FinnGen database, with validation performed using the UK Biobank (UKB) and GWAS Catalog databases. SMR analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between molecular characteristics of autophagy-related genes and RA. Subsequently, co-localization analysis was performed to determine whether the identified signals share the same causal genetic variants.

This population of common ducks was genotyped using a genetic map that included 334 genetic markers located across 28 APL chromosomes (APL for Anas platyrhynchos). Mule ducks were phenotyped for 49 traits related to growth, metabolism, overfeeding ability and meat and fatty liver quality, and 326 soluble fatty liver proteins were quantified.

The great majority of the identified pQTL were trans-acting and localized on a chromosome other than that carrying the coding gene. The most significant pQTL (1% genome-wide significance) were found for alpha-enolase on APL18 and fatty acid synthase on APL24.

We discovered new, previously unreported aging-associated proteomic traits (such as serum Albumin level), confirmed previously reported results from different tissues (i.e., upregulation of APOE with aging), and found loss of regulation of MMP7 in CD patients. In carrying out a genome wide genotype-protein association study (proteomic Quantitative Trait Loci, pQTL) within the CD patients, we identified 41 distinct proteomic traits influenced by cis pQTLs (underlying SNPs are referred to as pSNPs). Significant overlaps between pQTLs and cis eQTLs corresponding to the same gene were observed and in some cases the QTL were related to inflammatory disease susceptibility. Importantly, we discovered that serum protein levels of MST1 (Macrophage Stimulating 1) were regulated by SNP rs3197999 (p = 5.96E-10, FDR<5%), an accepted GWAS locus for IBD. Filling the knowledge gap of molecular mechanisms between GWAS hits and disease susceptibility requires systematically dissecting the impact of the locus at the cell, mRNA expression, and protein levels. The technology and analysis tools that are now available for large-scale molecular studies can elucidate how alterations in the proteome driven by genetic polymorphisms cause or provide protection against disease. Herein, we demonstrated this directly by integrating proteomic and pQTLs with existing GWAS, mRNA expression, and eQTL datasets to provide insights into the biological processes underlying IBD and pinpoint causal genetic variants along with their downstream molecular consequences.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34491321', 'title': 'The Effect of Phenotype and Genotype on the Plasma Proteome in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.', 'abstract': \"Protein profiling in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is underexplored.

A total of 92 inflammation-related proteins were quantified in plasma of 1028 patients with IBD (567 Crohn's disease [CD]; 461 ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 148 healthy individuals to assess protein-phenotype associations. Corresponding whole-exome sequencing and global screening array data of 919 patients with IBD were included to analyse the effect of genetics on protein levels (protein quantitative trait loci [pQTL] analysis). Intestinal mucosal RNA sequencing and faecal metagenomic data were used for complementary analyses. Thirty-two proteins were differentially abundant between IBD and healthy individuals, of which 22 proteins were independent of active inflammation; 69 proteins were associated with 15 demographic and clinical factors. Fibroblast growth factor-19 levels were decreased in CD patients with ileal disease or a history of ileocecal resection. Thirteen novel cis-pQTLs were identified and 10 replicated from previous studies. One trans-pQTL of the fucosyltransferase 2 [FUT2] gene [rs602662] and two independent cis-pQTLs of C-C motif chemokine 25 [CCL25] affected plasma CCL25 levels. Intestinal gene expression data revealed an overlapping cis-expression [e]QTL-variant [rs3745387] of the CCL25 gene. The FUT2 rs602662 trans-pQTL was associated with reduced abundances of faecal butyrate-producing bacteria. This study shows that genotype and multiple disease phenotypes strongly associate with the plasma inflammatory proteome in IBD, and identifies disease-associated pathways that may help to improve disease management in the future.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083538', 'title': 'Crowdsourced mapping of unexplored target space of kinase inhibitors.', 'abstract': 'Despite decades of intensive search for compounds that modulate the activity of particular protein targets, a large proportion of the human kinome remains as yet undrugged.

Genomic region enrichment analysis of the identified pQTL variants revealed 804 potential regulatory interactions among 595 predicted regulators (e.g., non-coding RNAs) and 394 proteins. Moreover, pQTL variants and trait-variant integration analysis implied several novel mechanisms underlying the relationships between protein expression and liver diseases, such as alcohol dependence. Notably, over 2000 of the identified pQTL variants have not been reported in previous eQTL studies, suggesting extensive involvement of genetic polymorphisms in post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression in human livers.

However, the contribution of blood-cell composition to plasma protein heterogeneity has not been fully characterized and may act as a mediating factor in association studies. Here, we evaluated plasma protein levels from 400 unrelated healthy individuals of western European ancestry, who were stratified by sex and two decades of life (20-29 and 60-69 years), from the Milieu Intérieur cohort. We quantified 229 proteins by Luminex in a clinically certified laboratory and their levels of variation were analyzed together with 5.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With respect to non-genetic variables, we included 254 lifestyle and biochemical factors, as well as counts of seven circulating immune cell populations measured by hemogram and standardized flow cytometry. Collectively, we found 152 significant associations involving 49 proteins and 20 non-genetic variables.

Instrumental for this next step are 'omics' technologies, which enable high-throughput characterization and quantification of biological molecules, and subsequent integration of genomics with these omics datasets, a field referred to as systems genomics. Single cell sequencing studies of the retina and choroid demonstrated that the majority of candidate AMD genes identified through genomic studies are expressed in non-neuronal cells, such as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), glia, myeloid and choroidal cells, highlighting that many different retinal and choroidal cell types contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies in retinal tissue have identified putative causal genes by demonstrating a genetic overlap between gene regulation and AMD risk. Linking genetic data to complement measurements in the systemic circulation has aided in understanding the effect of AMD-associated genetic variants in the complement system, and supports that protein QTL (pQTL) studies in plasma or serum samples may aid in understanding the effect of genetic variants and pinpointing causal genes in AMD. A recent epigenomic study fine-mapped AMD causal variants by determing regulatory regions in RPE cells differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE). Another approach that is being employed to pinpoint causal AMD genes is to produce synthetic DNA assemblons representing risk and protective haplotypes, which are then delivered to cellular or animal model systems. Pinpointing causal genes and understanding disease mechanisms is crucial for the next step towards clinical translation. Clinical trials targeting proteins encoded by the AMD-associated genomic loci C3, CFB, CFI, CFH, and ARMS2/HTRA1 are currently ongoing, and a phase III clinical trial for C3 inhibition recently showed a modest reduction of lesion growth in geographic atrophy. The EYERISK consortium recently developed a genetic test for AMD that allows genotyping of common and rare variants in AMD-associated genes. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were applied to quantify AMD genetic risk, and may aid in predicting AMD progression. In conclusion, genomic studies represent a turning point in our exploration of AMD. The results of those studies now serve as a driving force for several clinical trials.

Yet process evaluations often struggle to assess relevant contextual determinants, leaving much of the important role of \"context\" in shaping an intervention\\'s mechanisms opaque in many studies. A lack of easily adapted data collection methods to help define and operationalise indicators of context likely contributes to this. We present a method to help structure measures of context in process evaluations and describe its use in two very different settings. The \"Context Tracker\" is an innovative tool for use within trials and quasi-experiments to more systematically capture and understand key dimensions of context. It was developed in Zimbabwe as part of a cluster randomised controlled trial and then adapted for a quasi-experimental evaluation in the UK. Both studies provided harm reduction and health services for marginalised and hard-to-reach populations. We developed the Context Tracker to be both standardised (i.e. formatted and applied in the same way across study sites) and flexible enough to allow unique features to be explored in greater detail. Drawing on the Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions (CICI) and Risk Environments frameworks, we mapped 5 domains across micro, meso and macro levels in a simple table and used existing evidence and experience to predict factors likely to affect delivery of and participation in intervention components. We tracked these over time across study sites using routine programme statistics, observation and qualitative methods. The Context Tracker enables identification and comparison of facilitators and barriers to implementation, variations in engagement with interventions, and how mechanisms of action are (or are not) triggered in different settings. The Context Tracker is one example of how evidence-based contextual determinants can be used to guide data collection and analysis within process evaluations. It is relevant in low- and high-income settings and applicable to both qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Using randomizations, we statistically explored, previously overlooked basic patterns of mutually acting pairs, i.e. mutually positive (PP) or negative (NN) and positive-negative (PN) pairs, in two comprehensive and distinct large-scale molecular networks from literature; the human protein signaling network (PSN) and the human gene regulatory network (GRN). Only the positive and negative signs of all interacting pairs were randomized, while the gene pairs and the number of positive and negative signs in the original network were kept constant. While the numbers of NN and PN pairs were significantly higher, the number of PP pairs was significantly lower than randomly expected values. Genes participating in mutual pairs were more connected than other genes. NN genes were more connected than PP and PN in GRN for all types of degree values, including in, out, positive or negative connections, but less connected for in-degree and more connected for out-degree values in PSN. They also had significantly high number of intersections with each other and PN pairs than randomly expected values, indicating potential cooperative mechanisms. The three mutual interaction designs we examined had distinct RNA and protein expression correlation characteristics. NN protein pairs were uniquely over-represented across normal tissue samples, whose negative correlations were lost across cancer tissue samples. PP and PN pairs showed non-random positive RNA or protein expression correlation across normal or cancer tissue samples. Moreover, we developed an online tool, i.e. MGPNet, for further user specific analysis of mutual gene pairs. We identified SNCA with significantly enriched negatively correlated NN pairs.

Beyond their role in directly eliminating tumor cells, lipid peroxidation and its products, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), exert an additional influence by damaging DNA and shaping an environment conducive to tumor growth and metastasis. This process polarizes macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype, dampens the antigen-presenting capacity of dendritic cells (DCs), and undermines the cytotoxic functions of T and NK cells.

Osteogenic differentiation was assessed through in vitro assays and in vivo transplantation experiments. Gene expression profiles were quantified using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. A murine periodontitis model was used to validated therapeutic outcomes, with bone remodeling quantified by micro-CT and histology (H&E, Masson's staining). Immunophenotypic analysis of Jagged1 expression in Tregs and Notch2 receptor localization in PDLSCs were performed using flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. The role of immobilized Jagged1 in osteogenic differentiation was further evaluated, while Notch pathway inhibition was achieved via γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT in vitro. Elevated levels of Th17 cells and Tregs were observed in peripheral blood samples from periodontitis patients, with a significantly increased Th17/Treg ratio (p < 0.01). In vitro, co-culturing Tregs with PDLSCs significantly enhanced PDLSC osteogenesis, as evidenced by increased ALP activity (p < 0.01), elevated expression of osteogenesis-related genes (Runx2 and Osterix; p < 0.01), and enhanced mineralization (Alizarin Red staining) (p < 0.01). In vivo, intravenous infusion of Tregs into a periodontitis mouse model reduced periodontal damage and promoted bone regeneration, as demonstrated by reduced CEJ-ABC distance and increased BV/TV ratio (p < 0.01). Mechanistically, Tregs expressed the Notch ligand Jagged1 and upregulated Notch2 receptor expression in PDLSCs, indicating activation of the Notch signaling pathway. Jagged1 promoted osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

These interconnected mechanisms may worsen muscle atrophy, leading to a decline in physical efficiency and quality of life. While the therapeutic benefits of physical therapy and exercise have been investigated, the impact of dietary interventions remains underexplored. Given the established role of nutrition in managing various chronic diseases, there is growing interest in understanding how it might influence the clinical management of FSHD. By addressing current gaps in the literature, this review aims to investigate the potential role of dietary patterns and specific nutrients in modulating muscle metabolism within the context of FSHD. Some studies have indicated various compounds (flavonoids, curcumin, L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and omega-3), vitamins (C and E), and minerals (zinc and selenium) with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as promising treatment strategies for FSHD.

It is commonly acknowledged that developmental disorders significantly impact family life, but little is known about the day-to-day experiences of caregivers living with children with STXBP1-related disorders (STXBP1-RD). This knowledge gap may hinder researchers and care professionals from aligning research activities, care, and support with the perspectives of parents. We conducted a semi-structured interview study to gain a better understanding of the impact of having a child with STXBP1-RD on daily family life. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. We developed an 'analytical framework based on verbs', as verbs signify action, to present our results on the experiences of parents in everyday life. We conducted 16 interviews with 21 parents of children with STXBP1-RD (2 to 18 years old), living in the Netherlands. The respondents described their caregiving responsibilities as extremely intense and demanding. They reported being constantly occupied with caring for their child, and expressed a feeling of always being 'switched on'. Parents' experiences are described using the following five verbs: (1) caring for their child, (2) recognizing their child's needs and having their child's needs recognized, (3) searching for answers and suitable care, (4) balancing delivering care while preserving other domains of life, and (5) coping with emotional impacts. This study shows how parenting a child with STXBP1-RD involves continuous engagement with both child-related care responsibilities and other activities, such as arranging suitable care and coping with emotional impacts. The accumulation of these responsibilities and challenges significantly impacts the everyday lives of the entire family. To support STXBP1 patient families, a broad approach is needed, focusing not only on developing new medical treatments, but also on improving other therapies (e.g., speech therapy or physiotherapy) and providing social support for the entire family, including emotional support, assistance with administrative tasks, and improved information provision after diagnosis.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39700090', 'title': 'Exploring the mechanism of berberine treatment for atherosclerosis combined with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease based on bioinformatic and experimental study.', 'abstract': \"Atherosclerosis (AS) and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are chronic metabolic disorders with high prevalence and significant health impacts.

This study investigates BBR's impact on AS and NAFLD through bioinformatics analysis and experimental models. This study utilized various bioinformatics methods, including transcriptome analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), machine learning, and molecular docking, to identify key genes and pathways involved in AS and NAFLD. Subsequently an animal model of AS combined with NAFLD was established using ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. The efficacy and mechanism of action of BBR were verified using methods such as hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Oil Red O staining, and real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR). Through transcriptome analysis, WGCNA, and machine learning, this study identified 48 key genes involved in both AS and NAFLD. Function analysis revealed that the implicated genes were significantly involved in pathways like cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling, and IL-17 signaling pathway, suggesting their role in inflammation and immune responses. Single cell validation identified six key genes: dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5AR1), formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1), myeloid nuclear differentiation antigen (MNDA), and proviral integration site of murine 2(PIM2). Finally, molecular docking and animal experiments showed that BBR significantly reduced lipid deposits and inflammatory markers in liver and aortic tissues. In conclusion, BBR can improve AS combined with NAFLD by regulating genes like MNDA, PIM2, DUSP6, CCL3, C5AR1, and FPR1, with the mechanism related to inflammation control. The findings suggest potential clinical benefits of BBR in reducing the progression of both AS and NAFLD, warranting further investigation.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40300532', 'title': 'The impact of cadmium exposure on breast cancer risk: Exploring dose-response relationships and mediating effects.', 'abstract': 'Cadmium (Cd), an endocrine disruptor, has been linked to hormone-related cancers, including breast cancer (BC).

Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data guided by an interview outline developed by the theoretical framework. Content analysis was applied to analyze the interview data. The overarching theme of this study was: \"On the journey of breastfeeding, who will hold up the sky for me?\" This theme encapsulated the multifaceted challenges faced by mothers before discontinuing breastfeeding and their urgent need for comprehensive support. For these mothers, breastfeeding represented not only a physiological challenge but also a significant psychological and emotional burden. The analysis identified three primary categories: Microsystems-the challenges of breastfeeding and adaptation barriers; Mesosystems-dysfunctional support systems within families and hospitals; and Macrosystems-insufficient social support systems. Mothers of premature infants experienced weakened breastfeeding support systems, highlighting the need for (1) Enhancing psychological support and targeted breastfeeding guidance for mothers of preterm infants; (2) Establishing an evidence-based, coordinated support system that integrates hospital and family networks; (3) Strengthening monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for birth policies, enhancing breastfeeding facilities in public spaces, and improving the capacity for breastfeeding education and promotion within communities.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40268467', 'title': 'Dual Anti-inflammatory Actions of a Novel Retinoid X Receptor Agonist Derived from a Natural Compound in Microglial Cells.', 'abstract': \"Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. In a previous study, we synthesized 6-hydroxy-3'-propyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-propanoic acid (6OHA) based on the structure of magnaldehyde B, a natural compound that our group identified as a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist. However, its potential effects on inflammation in microglial cells remain unexplored. In this study, we specifically focused on the early-phase inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated the inhibitory effects of 6OHA on BV-2 microglial cells following 2 h of LPS exposure. Similar to the existing RXR agonist bexarotene (Bex), 6OHA treatment (0.1 and 1 μM) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (Il1b), Il6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. However, these effects on proinflammatory mediators were effectively abolished by the RXR antagonist UVI3003. Additionally, 6OHA promoted M2 microglia polarization after 24 h of treatment, as evidenced by the increased mRNA levels of the M2 marker genes arginase-1 (Arg1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 6 (Ccl6), Ccl17, and Ccl22. Notably, 6OHA induced a distinct set of M2 microglial markers compared with IL-4, a known M2 microglial inducer. Furthermore, the transcription of Arg1, a key M2 marker gene, is regulated by retinoic acid receptor/RXR heterodimers and the IL-4 signaling pathway. Collectively, 6OHA suppressed the early inflammatory responses to LPS and promoted M2 microglial polarization through a mechanism distinct from that of IL-4. Therefore, RXR agonists, including 6OHA and Bex, may exhibit dual anti-inflammatory effects and serve as novel modulators of neuroinflammation.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39958448', 'title': 'Reevaluating ', 'abstract': 'In this article, we comment on the work published by Huang '}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40278094', 'title': 'RNA-Seq Insight into the Impact and Mechanisms of Methyl Donor and Glycine Betaine Osmoprotectant on Polyketide Secondary Metabolism in ', 'abstract': 'Glycine betaine (GB) serves as both a methyl donor and osmoprotectant in microorganisms, facilitating growth and enhancing metabolic product yields.

Oxidative stress plays a crucial role in Cd-induced kidney injury, arising from an imbalance between cellular oxidation and antioxidation processes. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) has been identified as a significant factor in the initiation and advancement of multiple diseases, primarily due to its regulatory role in oxidative stress. Nevertheless, the specific role of BRD4 in Cd-induced kidney oxidative injury remains poorly understood. The present study demonstrates that BRD4 is activated in the kidney after Cd exposure, while JQ1 (a BRD4 inhibitor) treatment inhibits Cd-induced oxidative stress and kidney injury. Subsequently, we investigate the mechanisms by which Cd regulates oxidative stress both in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that JQ1 treatment reduces the expression levels of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), thereby alleviating mitochondrial damage and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Furthermore, JQ1 treatment facilitates nuclear translocation levels of Nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), thereby enhancing the antioxidant defense system in the kidney after Cd exposure. In conclusion, this study reveals that BRD4 is significantly involved in the process of Cd-induced oxidative damage in the kidney, while inhibiting BRD4 is observed to attenuate ROS generation by regulating Nox4 and enhance ROS scavenging by regulating Nrf2, which, in turn, suppresses the oxidative stress level in the kidney after Cd exposure. These findings suggest that targeting BRD4 may represent an effective strategy for the prevention and treatment of Cd-induced kidney diseases.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39998108', 'title': 'The Role of Botulinum Toxin for Masseter Muscle Hypertrophy: A Comprehensive Review.', 'abstract': 'Masticatory muscle hypertrophy (MMH) is a rare clinical phenomenon of uncertain etiology, characterized by a soft swelling near the angle of the jaw.

The power electronic converter has a limited ability to withstand overcurrent. So, protection needs to quickly identify the fault area in an extremely short time. Non-unit protection based on traveling waves has the advantage of rapid action, but its ability to resist fault resistance needs to be improved. To improve protection performance, a non-unit protection based on the ratio of initial fault voltage reversal wave (IVRW) tangent envelope area is proposed. First, the waveform distortion characteristics and the waveform characteristics of the IVRW at different fault locations are analyzed. Second, the tangent envelope area ratio is used to characterize the waveform distortion characteristics, which gets rid of the influence of fault resistance. Then, a fault identification criterion is constructed. And a protection scheme based on the tangent envelope area ratio is proposed by combining the start criterion and the fault pole criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has strong resistance to fault resistance and the setting value does not depend on simulation. In addition, the scheme can still effectively identify the protection area under weak boundaries and strong noise interference.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39931438', 'title': 'Transcriptome analysis reveals effects of ethynylestradiol and bisphenol A on multiple endocrine and metabolic pathways in the pituitary and liver of female Atlantic cod (', 'abstract': 'The pituitary and liver are among the main sites of action of estrogens in fish.

Some of these substances have a direct action on the degenerative activity that involves AD and may be associated with other pathological processes, such as inflammation and diabetes. These occurrences led us to investigate further whether the levels of certain substances may be associated with the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Biomarkers can be found in plasma, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid. This project investigated tau protein as a possible salivary biomarker in 76 patients, control group and Alzheimer's, with different age groups, to establish a positive correlation between the studied biomarker and AD. Our findings showed that phosphorylated tau (pTAU) concentrations are higher in AD patients and somewhat lower in elderly patients without Alzheimer's, but in young patients without Alzheimer's the levels are much lower.

This study aims to investigate the cardioprotective effects of XBJ in sepsis and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Network pharmacology was used to predict the potential active components and core targets of XBJ against SIMD. Furthermore, animal models were used to verify its pharmacodynamics. Metabolomics was integrated to track the myocardial tissue metabolites from septic rats. Molecular docking, qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the mechanisms of action. Network pharmacology predicted that the efficacy of XBJ is attributed to 104 active components and 178 targets. Metabolomics of myocardial tissue from CLP rats revealed that the key metabolic pathways included the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyrimidine metabolism, and purine metabolism.

In addition, we introduce a geometric constraint method for box edge detection and employ a Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based 2D-to-3D transformation approach for precise pose estimation. Experimental results show that STEGNet achieves 93.49% mAP on our proposed GY Warehouse Box View 4-Dimension (GY-WSBW-4D) dataset and 83.2% mAP on the WSGID-B dataset, surpassing existing benchmarks. The lightweight variant maintains competitive accuracy while reducing the model size by 34% and increasing the inference speed by 68%. In practical applications, the system achieves pose estimation with a Mean Absolute Error within 4 cm and a Rotation Angle Error below 2°, demonstrating robust performance in complex warehouse environments. This research provides a reliable solution for automated cargo stack monitoring in modern logistics systems.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40251514', 'title': 'Association of atherogenic index of plasma with kidney dysfunction in diabetic individuals: findings from two national population-based studies.', 'abstract': 'Extensive evidence suggests that dyslipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation, all of which can contribute to kidney dysfunction. The atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a novel marker of lipid metabolism disorder, but its role in kidney dysfunction in diabetic individuals remains controversial. This study aims to clarify the association of AIP with kidney dysfunction in diabetic individuals. This cross-sectional study analyzed a representative sample of participants aged 20 years and older from the United States (n\\u2009=\\u20092,386, NHANES 2007-2018) and Korea (n\\u2009=\\u2009698, KNHANES 2012). Weighted multivariate logistic regression analyses and smoothed curve fitting were conducted to investigate the relationship between logarithmically transformed AIP (lgAIP) and multiple kidney dysfunction, including albuminuria and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in diabetic individuals. Additionally, we conducted interaction analyses and subgroup analyses to assess whether this relationship remained consistent across different populations. We utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess and compare the diagnostic performance of AIP and other lipid indices for kidney dysfunction. In both databases, higher lgAIP was significantly associated with the occurrence of albuminuria in diabetic individuals (NHANES: OR\\u2009=\\u20097.69, 95%CI: 2.90-20.40; KNHANES: OR\\u2009=\\u20096.00, 95%CI: 1.05-34.36) in the fully adjusted model. However, the OR (95% CI) for the association between lgAIP and low-eGFR was 1.22 (0.33, 4.53) in the NHANES database and 2.50 (0.16, 38.62) in the KNHANES database, indicating no statistically significant association. Subgroup analysis revealed that the association between lgAIP and albuminuria in diabetic individuals was influenced by age and BMI stratification in the NHANES database, and by BMI stratification in the KNHANES database (p for interaction\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Compared to other lipid indicators, AIP appears to be more precise and discriminatory in predicting albuminuria in diabetic individuals. Our findings highlight a strong association between lgAIP and albuminuria in diabetic individuals. Future research should explore the mechanisms that underlying this relationship.

Brusatol (BRU), a compound extracted from Brucea javanica, has shown promising anti-tumor properties in various cancers; however, its effects on OS have yet to be investigated. To investigate the anti-tumor mechanisms of BRU in OS and evaluate its potential therapeutic efficacy, with a particular focus on its impact on lipid metabolism and related signaling pathways. In vitro experiments to assess the anti-tumor effects of BRU involved colony formation, CCK-8, Transwell analysis, as well as flow cytometry. RNA sequencing was conducted to identify transcriptional changes in BRU-treated cells. The mechanism of action was investigated through analysis of lipid metabolism and key signaling pathways. Therapeutic efficacy and safety were evaluated in vivo using xenograft models. BRU significantly inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while also inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest as well as promoting apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis revealed that BRU affected lipid metabolism-related genes and suppressed the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways. BRU treatment reduced fatty acid synthase expression and free fatty acid content in OS cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that BRU effectively restricted xenograft growth.

A mouse model of HUA was established, and the gut microbiota and microbiome-derived metabolites were analyzed via 16S RNA gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis. The mechanism of the gut microbiota in HUA was elucidated by in vivo and in vitro experiments. Antibiotic treatment elevated serum UA, disturbed purine metabolism, and decreased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. HUA mice had a lower relative abundance of Lactobacillus johnsonii (L. johnsonii) and decreased gut butyrate concentration. Supplementation of L. johnsonii significantly reduces serum UA in hyperuricemia mice by preventing UA synthesis and promoting the excretion of gut purine metabolites. In addition, L. johnsonii enhanced intestinal UA excretion by heightening the urate transporter ABCG2 (adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter, subfamily G, member 2) expression, and increasing the levels of butyrate, which upregulated ABCG2 expression via the Wnt5a/b/β-catenin signaling pathway.

All investigated parameters except CD opening angle were statistically significantly different between two groups. MPD opening angle was more acute in the control group. Parallel and tortuous CD was more common in the patient group. Patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis were more likely to have CD opening to the second and third parts of CBD.

Preliminary human studies, including case reports and observational studies, indicate potential benefits such as mood stabilization, increased energy, and reduced depression severity. Proposed mechanisms include immune-inflammatory regulation, correction of mitochondrial dysfunction, and neurotransmitter modulation.

Our results evinced that the shapes of the action potential and the propagating wavefront can be modulated through the fractional order under both healthy and AF conditions. Moreover, the asymmetry factor changes with variations in the fractional order. For a given propagation pattern under AF conditions, variation intervals for the asymmetry factor can be generated by forming sets of simulations with different configurations for the fractional order, representing diverse samples of atrial tissue with varying degrees of structural heterogeneity. This approach successfully reproduces the electrogram negative deflection predominance seen in AF patients, which standard integer-order models cannot predict.

Robust capuchins, the genus Sapajus, are an excellent convergent model system for understanding tool use evolution, principally in the context of foraging, in terms of how they use stones to process hard fruits. However, most published studies of capuchin tool use in the wild focus on the species Sapajus libidinosus. In order to strengthen comparative analyses, it is important to do research across robust capuchin species to understand tool use capacities and variation across the genus. The first indirect evidence that reported tool use in wild S. xanthosternos was in 2009, but since that time no additional publications have described this behavior for this species. In this study we provide the first complete characterization of tool use in wild S. xanthosternos for two areas within Montes Claros, Minas Gerais state, Brazil: Santa Rosa de Lima district, and Lapa Grande State Park. We compare our findings to the stone tool use characteristics reported in wild Sapajus libidinosus and other capuchin monkey species. In monthly surveys from January to September 2018, we walked trails through the two study areas and categorized tool use site characteristics, including anvil area, height, and perimeter; hammer stone weight; and species of fruit utilized. Additionally, we utilized camera traps at high-use sites. We describe the tools used by S. xanthosternos at 169 sites clustered in seven Nutcracking Areas, for processing three different species of encased fruit: Macaúba (Acrocomia aculeata), Cansaçao (Cnidoscolus pubescens), and Guariroba (Syagrus oleracea). With camera traps, we directly observed tool use behavior for the first time in this species. Sapajus xanthosternos displayed tool use patterns very similar to those of S. libidinosus. The main difference was in regards to physical force; in our study, the mean weight of stones used by S. xanthosternos was higher than the mean reported for S. libidinosus at most field sites; however, there was no difference in hammer weight between S. libidinosus and S. xanthosternos when hammering Macaúba. We also registered the heaviest hammer stone for tool use (7.675\\u2009kg) known for the robust capuchin genus. It is clear from our study that tool use capacity and characteristics are conserved across the radiation of extant Sapajus, suggesting a possible stone tool use cognitive capacity spanning up to 3.3 million years of diversification within this genus.

Nonetheless, issues such as the formation of \"dead Sn\" due to excessively large deposition sizes and electrolyte-driven side reactions severely constrain the reversibility of the Sn anode, which hinders the further development of this emerging field. In response to these hurdles, numerous significant efforts have been proposed to tailor Sn plating/stripping chemistry in the past three years. Considering the lack of comprehensive summaries focused on recent advances for Sn anode stabilization, herein, we present a systematic review to deepen our understanding of Sn chemistry. This review commences by presenting the fundamental electrochemical working principle and associated challenges of Sn anodes in aqueous electrolytes, under either acidic or alkaline conditions. Subsequently, we systematically scrutinize recent research progress on optimization strategies for Sn anodes, focusing on electrolyte formulation modification and electrode structure design. Furthermore, specific cathode materials compatible with the Sn anode are discussed, classifying into conversion- and intercalation-types in view of their distinct reaction mechanism. Finally, suggestions and perspectives are provided for the future design of highly reversible Sn anodes. This work is anticipated to shed light on the construction of advanced aqueous Sn batteries.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39737929', 'title': 'Design of an equilibrative nucleoside transporter subtype 1 inhibitor for pain relief.', 'abstract': 'The current opioid crisis urgently calls for developing non-addictive pain medications. Progress has been slow, highlighting the need to uncover targets with unique mechanisms of action. Extracellular adenosine alleviates pain by activating the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R). However, efforts to develop A1R agonists have faced obstacles. The equilibrative nucleoside transporter subtype 1 (ENT1) plays a crucial role in regulating adenosine levels across cell membranes. We postulate that ENT1 inhibition may enhance extracellular adenosine levels, potentiating endogenous adenosine action at A1R and leading to analgesic effects. Here, we modify the ENT1 inhibitor dilazep based on its complex X-ray structure and show that this modified inhibitor reduces neuropathic and inflammatory pain in animal models while dilazep does not. Notably, our ENT1 inhibitor surpasses gabapentin in analgesic efficacy in a neuropathic pain model. Additionally, our inhibitor exhibits less cardiac side effect than dilazep via systemic administration and shows no side effects via local/intrathecal administration. ENT1 is colocalized with A1R in mouse and human dorsal root ganglia, and the analgesic effect of our inhibitor is linked to A1R. Our studies reveal ENT1 as a therapeutic target for analgesia, highlighting the promise of rationally designed ENT1 inhibitors for non-opioid pain medications.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40229499', 'title': 'Lipin1-dependent transcriptional inactivation of SREBPs contributes to selinexor sensitivity in multiple myeloma.', 'abstract': 'Selective nuclear export inhibitor selinexor (SEL) represents a promising therapeutic strategy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).

During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves' disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves' disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves' disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases.

Anillin mediates unilateral furrowing during cytokinesis in the one-cell C. elegans zygote by limiting myosin II accumulation in the ring. Here, we address the role of anillin in this process and show that anillin inhibits not only the accumulation of myosin II but also of other RhoA effectors by binding and blocking the RhoA effector site. The interaction between the anillin's RhoA-binding domain (RBD) and active RhoA is enhanced by the disordered linker region and differentially regulated at the leading and lagging edge, which together results in asymmetric RhoA signaling and accumulation of myosin II. In summary, we discover a RhoA GEF- and GAP-independent mechanism, where RhoA activity is limited by anillin binding to the RhoA effector site. Spatial fine-tuning of anillin's inhibitory role on RhoA signaling enables unilateral furrow ingression and contributes to animal development.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39663115', 'title': 'Sex Differences in Central Amygdala Glutamate Responses to Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide.', 'abstract': 'Women are disproportionately affected by chronic pain compared with men. While societal and environmental factors contribute to this disparity, sex-based biological differences in the processing of pain are also believed to play significant roles. The central lateral nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) is a key region for the emotional-affective dimension of pain, and a prime target for exploring sex differences in pain processing since a recent study demonstrated sex differences in CGRP actions in this region. Inputs to CeLC from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) play a causal role in aversive processing and release both glutamate and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP is thought to play a crucial role in chronic pain by potentiating glutamatergic signaling in CeLC. However, it is not known if this CGRP-mediated synaptic plasticity occurs similarly in males and females. Here, we tested the hypothesis that female CeLC neurons experience greater potentiation of glutamatergic signaling than males following endogenous CGRP exposure. Using trains of optical stimuli to evoke transient CGRP release from PB terminals in CeLC, we find that subsequent glutamatergic responses are preferentially potentiated in CeLC neurons from female mice. This potentiation was CGRP dependent and involved a postsynaptic mechanism. This sex difference in CGRP sensitivity may explain sex differences in affective pain processing.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40248543', 'title': 'Techniques for Local Anesthesia in Transperineal and Transrectal Prostate Biopsy: An Image-based Step-by-Step Guide With Dedication to Anatomy.', 'abstract': \"Prostate biopsy is the cornerstone in the diagnostic pathway of prostate cancer. It's normally performed using local or general anesthesia. The prostate's high sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and irritation is due to its complex nerve supply, mainly from the pelvic plexus.

As the procedure involves needle penetration into sensitive tissues, it is essential to ensure effective peribioptic pain management, as patients may experience considerable discomfort during the process. Local anesthesia has proven to be one of the safest, most reliable, and most effective approaches to managing this pain, as it provides targeted relief with minimal side effects.

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), crucial for immune cell function and survival, is implicated in AS pathogenesis. This study explores OXPHOS-related mechanisms in AS, identifies key genes using machine learning, and highlights potential therapeutic targets for precision medicine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) bulk transcriptomic and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from AS patients were analyzed to investigate the role of the OXPHOS pathway in AS. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify key gene modules associated with OXPHOS. Machine learning techniques, including support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), random forest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), were applied to identify significant AS-related genes. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantify gene expression, examine their patterns in specific cell subtypes, and explore their functional implications. Pathway enrichment analysis identified OXPHOS as a significantly enriched pathway distinguishing AS patients from healthy controls, with high normalized enrichment scores and significant group separation in principal component analysis. ScRNA-seq revealed significantly higher OXPHOS scores in AS patients, especially in dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes, highlighting cell type-specific dysregulation. WGCNA identified two key gene modules (MEyellow and MEtan) that are closely associated with OXPHOS. Three hub genes-LAMTOR2, APBB1IP, and DGKQ-were screened using machine learning methods and validated by RT-PCR and scRNA-seq. Among them, LAMTOR2 was significantly more highly expressed in patients with AS, and functional analyses showed that it plays a role in promoting TH17 cell differentiation, which highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for ankylosing spondylitis. This multi-omics study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between OXPHOS and AS. The identified genes, particularly LAMTOR2, serve as potential therapeutic targets, contributing to our understanding of AS mechanisms and paving the way for precision medicine in AS treatment.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40247359', 'title': 'Oral health effects of non-combustible nicotine products: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'abstract': 'Tobacco use is a global issue, and non-combustible nicotine products (NCNPs) like electronic nicotine delivery systems, nicotine pouches, snus, and nicotine replacement therapies offer potential risk/harm reduction for smokers unable or unwilling to quit.

Anterograde and retrograde viral tracing combined with immunofluorescence staining was used to validate the activated neurons-involved neuronal pathway. We performed optogenetic stimulation and behavioral observation to dissect the brain neural circuitry that underlies the modulation of trigeminal neuropathic pain. We further conducted dual-color fiber photometry to analyze dynamic neurotransmitter release and real-time neuronal activity while observing pain behaviors simultaneously. We observed that mouse neurons in the anterior paraventricular nucleus of thalamus were activated specifically by chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve. We further observed that specifical excitation or silencing of the activated neurons bidirectionally modulated the nerve injury-caused trigeminal neuropathic pain in mice. More importantly, optogenetic activation of the brain neural circuit from anterior paraventricular nucleus of thalamus to anterior cingulate cortex exacerbated such pain and this effect was blocked by an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist. Meanwhile, optogenetic activation of this neural circuit markedly increased glutamate release and enhanced neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex.

Infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) action spectroscopy experiments are performed to probe structural effects, whereas energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation (ER-CID) experiments combined with survival yield analyses are performed to probe their effects on glycosidic bond stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to determine the stable low-energy conformations available to these systems, their relative stabilities, and infrared (IR) spectra.

Organophosphates inhibit the antioxidant paraoxonase, and reactive oxygen species are produced during organophosphate metabolism. Organophosphates disrupt the function of mitochondria, the principal source of free radicals. Organophosphates also induce neuroinflammation, which generates reactive oxygen species, and reactive oxygen species in turn stimulate neuroinflammation. Markers of reactive oxygen species are elevated in vitro and in vivo after exposure to organophosphates and in individuals professionally exposed to organophosphates.

Here, we used a combination of genome-wide association (GWA), developmental gene expression, and photoreceptor electrophysiology to investigate the architecture of mate choice behavior in Heliconius cydno butterflies, a clade where males identify preferred mates based on wing color patterns. We first found that the GWA variants most strongly associated with male mate choice were tightly linked to the gene controlling wing color in the K locus, consistent with previous mapping efforts. RNA-seq across developmental time points then showed that seven genes near the top GWA peaks were differentially expressed in the eyes, optic lobes, or central brain of white and yellow H. cydno males, many of which have known functions in the development and maintenance of synaptic connections. In the visual system of these butterflies, we identified a striking physiological difference between yellow and white males that could provide an evolutionarily labile circuit motif in the eye to rapidly switch behavioral preference. Using single-cell electrophysiology recordings, we found that some ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive photoreceptors receive inhibition from long-wavelength photoreceptors in the male eye. Surprisingly, the proportion of inhibited UV photoreceptors was strongly correlated with male wing color, suggesting a difference in the early stages of visual processing that could plausibly influence courtship decisions. We discuss potential links between candidate genes and this physiological signature, and suggest future avenues for experimental work.

The previous study identified Class 1 integron integrase (IntI-1), a tyrosine site-specific recombinase involved in horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, as a potential interaction partner of Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo), a member of pAgos. Here, we demonstrated that this interaction was direct, depended on the PIWI domain, and was independent of the catalytic activity of NgAgo. Notably, no interaction occurred between NgAgo and Cre (another tyrosine site-specific recombinase), highlighting the specificity of NgAgo-IntI-1 interaction. Furthermore, NgAgo could inhibit binding of IntI-1 to its target DNA, and then impede IntI-1-mediated integration and excision. Consistent with the above finding, few pAgos could be found in prokaryotic genomes containing IntI, whereas IntI showed significant co-occurrence with another bacterial defense system, CRISPR-Cas.

Exosomes are involved in strategic phases of the onset and development of atherosclerosis because they have been identified to control pathophysiologic pathways including inflammation, angiogenesis, or senescence. This review investigates the potential role of stem cell-derived exosomes in atherosclerosis management. We briefly introduced atherosclerosis and stem cell therapy including stem cell-derived exosomes. The biogenesis of exosomes along with their secretion and isolation have been elaborated. The design engineering of exosomes has been summarized to present how drug loading and surface modification with targeting ligands can improve the therapeutic and targeting capacity of exosomes, demonstrating atheroprotective action.

However, its epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and associated transcriptional consequences remain poorly characterized. In this study, we integrated biochemical assays with a panel of cellular analyses assessing cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, and migratory capacity to investigate NCTD's therapeutic potential in HCC progression. Potential molecular targets of NCTD were systematically identified through integrated network pharmacology approaches. Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) was performed to quantify H3K27me3 enrichment level at the TOP2A locus in NCTD-treated HCC cells. Molecular docking simulations were employed to examine structural interactions between NCTD and EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), while co-immunoprecipitation assays were further conducted to validate protein-protein interactions between EZH2 and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). We identified topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) as a critical molecular target mediating NCTD's anti-HCC effects. Functional characterization revealed that NCTD significantly attenuated HCC cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest through disruption of the TOP2A-p53 signaling axis. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that NCTD epigenetically suppresses TOP2A transcription via PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)-mediated deposition of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 at the TOP2A promoter. Structural biology analyses confirmed direct binding of NCTD to EZH2 protein, consequently impairing PP1-mediated dephosphorylation and enhancing PRC2 complex stability. Our findings establish that NCTD exerts anticancer effects in HCC through epigenetic silencing of TOP2A. This work not only elucidates a novel pharmacoepigenetic mechanism underlying NCTD's antitumor activity but also provides translational rationale for developing PRC2-targeted therapeutic strategies in HCC management.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40260592', 'title': 'The integrative biology of decoy coloration in lizards.', 'abstract': 'Anti-predator coloration is a widespread phenomenon that includes such tactics as aposematism, crypsis and mimicry.

New advances in phylogenetics, genomics and molecular biology have allowed for an enriched understanding of the integrative biology of this type of anti-predator trait, particularly in lizards.

The mechanism of action of DHM was explored by RT-qPCR, ELISA, luciferase reporter gene assay and western blotting. DHM dose-dependently enhanced BV2 cell viability post-OGD/R and attenuated inflammation and oxidative stress. The protective effects of DHM were found to be mediated through the downregulation of SNHG17, which in turn modulated miR-452-3p expression. miR-452-3p was identified as a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory CXCR4, a direct target whose expression was inversely affected by SNHG17.

Furthermore, manipulation of the SNHG17/miR-452-3p/CXCR4 axis was shown to modulate the NF-κB signaling pathway as evidenced by changes in phosphorylation levels. In conclusion, our findings elucidate a novel DHM-mediated neuroprotective mechanism in microglial cells involving the SNHG17/miR-452-3p/CXCR4 regulatory axis.

Understanding these experiences is crucial for improving patient access. This study aimed to 1) describe the Paxlovid prescribing process in community pharmacies and 2) explore associated barriers and facilitators. This exploratory qualitative study involved semi-structured virtual interviews with pharmacists in Wisconsin (June-September 2023). Pharmacists were identified using the Wisconsin Department of Health Services list of pharmacies offering Paxlovid and the Pharmacy Practice Enhancement and Action Research Link network. The interview guide, pre-tested with one pharmacist, was informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis guided by the CFIR were used. Five pharmacists were interviewed, including three in leadership roles. One represented a pharmacy partnering with two health systems, while another represented a healthcare system collaborating with 15 independent pharmacies. On average, pharmacists dispensed 130 (±142) Paxlovid doses, with eligibility screening taking 5 to 45 minutes, conducted in person, by phone, or via electronic health records (EHR). The prescribing process involved two steps: 1) assessing eligibility and 2) dispensing the appropriate prescription, with slight variations based on pharmacy's EHR access. Key themes describing facilitators and barriers to Paxlovid prescribing emerged within four CFIR domains (i.e., inner setting, outer setting, individual characteristics, and process). Major barriers included limited access to patient health information and inadequate reimbursement. Facilitators included access to decision-making support tools, compatibility, and the ability to screen and counsel patients remotely. Community pharmacists are vital to expanding access to Paxlovid but struggle with limited access to patient health information and inadequate reimbursement. Ensuring EHR access and advocating for provider status will enhance patient care. Involving pharmacists in public health program design can optimize resource allocation and effectiveness.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40020517', 'title': 'Phenothiazines boost host control of Mycobacterium avium infection in primary human macrophages.', 'abstract': \"Mycobacterium avium (Mav) complex is the leading cause of pulmonary diseases associated with non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections worldwide. The inherent and increasing acquired antibiotic resistance of Mav hampers the treatment of Mav infections and emphasizes the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies. A promising approach is host-directed therapy (HDT), which aims to boost the host's immune defenses to combat infections. In this study, we show that phenothiazines, particularly trifluoperazine (TFP) and chlorproethazine (CPE), restricted Mav survival in primary human macrophages. Notably, TFP and CPE did not directly inhibit mycobacterial growth at used concentrations, confirming these drugs function through host-dependent mechanisms. TFP and CPE induced a mild, albeit not statistically significant, increase in autophagic flux along with the nuclear intensity of transcription factor EB (TFEB), the master transcriptional regulator of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagic flux with bafilomycin, however, did not impair the improved host infection control by TFP and CPE, suggesting that the host (auto)phagolysosomal pathway is not causally involved in the mechanism of action of TFP and CPE. Additionally, TFP and CPE increased the production of both cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Scavenging mitochondrial ROS did not impact, whereas inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX)-mediated ROS production partially impaired the HDT activity of TFP and CPE, indicating that oxidative burst may play a limited role in the improved host control of Mav infection by these drugs. Overall, our study demonstrates that phenothiazines are promising HDT candidates that enhance the antimicrobial response of macrophages against Mav, through mechanism(s) that were partially elucidated.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40316100', 'title': 'Inhibition of pancreatic lipase and cholesterol by hawthorn extract: A study of binding mechanisms and inhibitor screening.', 'abstract': 'Inhibiting the activity of pancreatic lipase and reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption are potential strategies to combat obesity.

The DMPPT2 Online was upgraded to align with the Spectrum and Naomi models used in the Annual HIV Estimates process. In addition, new and revised inputs were incorporated to enhance accuracy of modelled outputs. The process was successful in mobilizing stakeholders behind efforts to integrate VMMC into the annual HIV Estimates process and generating comprehensive, country-owned and validated VMMC data that will enhance programme monitoring and planning. VMMC programme data from most of the priority countries were successfully reviewed, updated, validated and incorporated into the annual HIV Estimates process in 2020. It is important to ensure that these data continue to be used for programme planning and management. Current and future data issues will need to be addressed, and countries will need ongoing support to do so. The integration of the DMPPT2 Online into the annual HIV Estimates process is a positive step forward in terms of streamlining country-owned planning and analytical practices for the HIV response.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35484864', 'title': 'Assessment of occlusion and temporomandibular joint after placing preformed metal crowns on all primary molars in children.', 'abstract': \"Placing preformed metal crowns (PMCs) on all eight primary molars at one single clinical visit may disrupt a child's occlusion; the literature regarding the effects on occlusion and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is scarce. This study aimed to quantify the changes in occlusion using T-Scan III and to investigate whether there was TMJ dysfunction after placing eight PMCs at the same time. In this study, we enrolled children with severe early childhood caries (S-ECC) and dental phobia, who needed eight PMCs to be placed under general anesthesia. The participants underwent occlusal examinations with a computed occlusal analysis system.

In human patients, ACL injuries are often treated with ACL reconstruction. However, it is still unclear how effective joint restabilization is for reducing the progression of PTOA. The goal of this study was to determine how surgical restabilization of a mouse knee joint following non-invasive ACL injury affects PTOA progression. In this study, 187 mice were subjected to non-invasive ACL injury or no injury. After injury, mice underwent restabilization surgery, sham surgery, or no surgery. Mice were then euthanized on day 14 or day 49 after injury/surgery. Functional analyses were performed at multiple time points to assess voluntary movement, gait, and pain. Knees were analyzed ex vivo with micro-computed tomography, RT-PCR, and whole-joint histology to assess articular cartilage degeneration, synovitis, and osteophyte formation. Both ACL injury and surgery resulted in loss of epiphyseal trabecular bone (-27-32%) and reduced voluntary movement at early time points. Joint restabilization successfully lowered OA score (-78% relative to injured at day 14, p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001), and synovitis scores (-37% relative to injured at day 14, p\\xa0=\\xa00.042), and diminished the formation of chondrophytes/osteophytes (-97% relative to injured at day 14, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001, -78% at day 49, p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). This study confirmed that surgical knee restabilization was effective at reducing articular cartilage degeneration and diminishing chondrophyte/osteophyte formation after ACL injury in mice, suggesting that these processes are largely driven by joint instability in this mouse model. However, restabilization was not able to mitigate the early inflammatory response and the loss of epiphyseal trabecular bone, indicating that these processes are independent of joint instability.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32368469', 'title': 'The Outside-In Technique for Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis: A Safe and Reproducible Approach in Hip Arthroscopy.', 'abstract': 'Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome caused by slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) can be successfully treated arthroscopically and with the minimally invasive, outside-in surgical technique.

Despite its clinical importance, therapeutic options for HI injury remain limited. Here we demonstrated that miR-34c-5p expression peaks at postnatal day 10 in mice. Meanwhile, the miR-34c-5p levels in the lesioned cortex decreased following HI insult in neonatal mice. miR-34c-5p overexpression confers neuroprotective effects by attenuating brain injury and ROS production. These protective mechanisms were mediated through the inhibition of caspase 3 activation, suppression of microglial activation, and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the injured cortex. In contrast, miR-34c-5p downregulation markedly aggravated the infarct area after HI injury. Additionally, miR-34c-5p overexpression improved short-term motor coordination and long-term neurological outcomes, including locomotor activity, learning, and memory functions, which were associated with upregulated synaptic protein expression. Importantly, we developed a non-invasive intranasal delivery system using liposome-encapsulated miR-34c-5p mimics, which significantly ameliorated brain injury at 3 days post-HI. Mechanistic studies revealed that miR-34c-5p directly targets the 3' untranslated region of GTPase activating protein 26 (Arhgap26).

Therefore, its use has been increasing recently in envenomation cases. However, there are a limited number of studies on poisoning due to snakebite and CCHF. In the present study, we share our TPE experience retrospectively in patients diagnosed with poisoning due to snakebite and CCHF between 2010 and 2019. A total of 26 patiens, including 20 patients with poisoning due to snakebite and 6 CCHF patients were treated with TPE. Demographic data, clinical status, and outcomes of patients were recorded. Routine biochemical and hematologic laboratory parameters were analyzed before and after TPE. TPE was performed by using centrifugation technology via a central venous catheter. Fresh frozen plasma was used as replacement fluid. An average of 3.95 (1-11) apheresis sessions were applied to patients poisoned due to snakebite, and 19 patients (95 %) were discharged in an average of 8.3 (1-17) days without any complications. None of the patients enrolled in the study lost their limbs. Only one patient died due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Six patients with CCHF who received 5 sessions of TPE on average were discharged successfully after an average of 6.5 days. No adverse events or complications were observed in any patient after TPE. TPE is a good alternative and a reliable method in treating envenomation cases who are refractory to supportive measures.

However, defining these treatments clearly is crucial for proper clinical application. Orthobiologics include biologic substances that enhance healing, such as cell-based therapies and blood-derived products. Among these, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is widely used, but its classification remains complex due to variations in preparation methods, platelet concentration, leucocyte content, and activation techniques. Strictly, the term 'PRP' refers to plasma enriched in platelets relative to baseline blood levels. Yet, scientific debate persists regarding whether platelet count or enrichment is more significant in clinical outcomes. Additionally, leucocyte-rich and leucocyte-poor PRPs offer different therapeutic advantages depending on the target tissue, complicating standardization. Similarly, the presence of red blood cells is generally discouraged, given their association with joint inflammation. Beyond the classical 'PRP' formulations, alternative blood-derived products offer distinct biological effects. A standardized classification system is therefore essential for research and clinical application, emphasizing precise documentation of products' characteristics, including platelet count, activation state and bioactive molecule interactions. Understanding these variables and their impact on patient-specific conditions will refine orthopaedic regenerative strategies and optimize treatment efficacy.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450908', 'title': 'Natural Biomaterial-Based Edible and pH-Sensitive Films Combined with Electrochemical Writing for Intelligent Food Packaging.', 'abstract': 'An edible and pH-sensitive film combined with electrochemical writing was developed by using gelatin, gellan gum, and red radish anthocyanins extract for intelligent food packaging.

In this prospective study, HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patients treated with Peg-IFN-α were followed for 48 weeks. The participants were classified into two groups, the virological response (VR) group and nonvirological response (NVR) group, according to the changes in HBV DNA and HBsAg levels observed at week 48 of treatment. Furthermore, these patients were divided into a serological response (SR) group and a nonserological response (NSR) group, depending on whether they exhibited a loss of serum HBsAg or evidence of seroconversion. The expression levels of LY6E and TRIM6 mRNAs in PBMCs were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR with fluorescence detection. The diagnostic performance of LY6E and TRIM6 was assessed by analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC). After the treatment period, the observed VR and SR rates were 44.64% and 28.57%, respectively. Dynamic changes in LY6E and TRIM6 mRNA levels were significantly different between the VR and NVR groups and between the SR and NSR groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that TRIM6 was independently associated with VR at weeks 12 and 24 of Peg-IFN-α therapy and with SR at week 12; in addition, LY6E was independently associated with VR at week 12 and SR at week 24.

The simulated water distribution on the protein surface is first validated by successfully predicting water vapor sorption isotherms for both amorphous and crystalline insulin. The \"hockey stick\"-type behavior is explained by a water threshold level beyond which there are two (Asn-Gly sequence in IgG1) or three (Asn at the C-terminus in insulin) water molecules assisting the cyclization reactions. Regarding the inverted bell-shaped profile for amorphous IgG1, the initial decreases in deamidation rate with increasing water content at low water levels can be rationalized by a lower density and higher free volume of IgG1 at a lower water content. When the free volume exceeds a percolation threshold, the produced ammonia gas can easily diffuse away, lowering the back reaction rate and thus raising the overall reaction rate. The \"free volume\" mechanism can also be applied to the abnormal stability ranking orders of crystalline and amorphous insulin. The faster deamidation and dimerization rates in insulin crystals compared to amorphous insulin as reported by Pikal and Rigsbee are due to the lower density and higher free volume (above the percolation threshold) in crystalline insulin, assuming that dehydration of insulin crystals does not result in a major collapse of the crystal structure.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40234620', 'title': 'Pregnane X receptor alleviates sepsis-induced liver injury through activation of yes-associated protein in mice.', 'abstract': 'The severity of sepsis is attributed to excessive inflammatory responses leading to liver injury.

Consequently, 718 initial QTLs were refined into 74 MQTLs, which were distributed on all wheat chromosomes except 1D, 3\\xa0A, 4B, and 5B.

In general, the predictive method for protein-ligand binding affinity mainly relies on high-resolution protein crystal structure data; however, some protein crystals are difficult to culture, time-consuming, and expensive to obtain. In this study, two sequence-based neural network deep learning models - DeepPQK and DeepQK, were constructed to predict the protein-ligand binding affinity. DeepPQK was developed by integrating local and global contextual features using convolutional neural networks(CNN) with protein sequences, pocket amino acids, and ligands as input. In particular, the protein-binding pocket, which possesses special properties for directly binding the ligand, was used as the local input feature for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. DeepQK, consisting of a protein sequence module and a ligand module, utilizes these features for its predictions, enabling the identification of the intrinsic relationship between protein sequence and affinity. Specifically, dilated convolution was used to capture multiscale long-range interactions and the special sequence-level features of a protein and ligand. When tested on the 2016 core dataset, the Pearson correlation coefficient of DeepPQK and DeepQK reached 0.805 and 0.804 respectively, which is a significant accuracy improvement compared with the recent state-of-art methods. Both models, once trained, can learn the two- and three-dimensional structural properties of proteins, and the relative position relationship between proteins and ligands. Based on the results, a series of variants of feruloyl esterase DLFae4 were designed using DeepPQK and DeepQK, and the enzyme activity of these mutations was verified by experiments, among which the optimal mutant I149G/W237H/M297C improved 5.6-fold enzyme activity and 10.1-fold catalytic efficiency than the wild-type enzyme. In conclusion, DeepPQK and DeepQK deep learning models overcome the limitations of traditional methods that depend on protein crystal structures and have been successfully applied to guide the directed evolution of enzymes, providing a new approach to studying enzyme-directed evolution.

Furthermore, oxidative stress in pancreatic islet β cells was detected by dihydroethidium staining. A HSHF diet and STZ injection induced T2DM, as indicated by changed blood glucose and body weight, which was accompanied by insulin resistance, an altered lipid profile, and oxidative stress. Interestingly, EGCG treatment dose-dependently recovered these indexes.

Stress fractures, otherwise known as fatigue fractures, result from abnormal and repetitive strain of healthy bone. This leads to micro damages and subsequent fractures. They are most commonly encountered after a sudden and excessive increase in physical activity and most frequently located in the metatarsal, heel, tibia, fibula and femur. This case presents a twenty-nine year old patient, diagnosed with obesity, not involved in sport ever before. Since the end of the spring, he started to exercise intensively at the gym, particularly lifting weights. Since the end of summer, he developed increasingly frequent feet pain, so he reported to an orthopedist. An ultrasound examination of the ankle joints was performed and it did not show any soft tissue damage. Subsequent MR imaging of both ankle joints showed a fatigue fracture: the talus bone of both feet and in the left cuboid bone. Excessive physical effort, especially in patients who have not previously participated in sport, can cause fatigue fractures. The diagnostic procedure should include patient's history, X-ray and ultrasound. Fractures at an early stage may not be visible on X- rays, however an MR examination can reveal bone lesions or a fracture line. In the treatment of stress fractures, modification of activity, use of orthosis, direct cooling, short term use of pain drugs and rehabilitation are usually recommended.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595350', 'title': 'Chondroblastoma of mandibular condyle: Case report and literature review.', 'abstract': 'Chondroblastoma is one of the uncommon benign bone tumors, particularly when located in the mandibular condyle.

However, they also carry the risk of increased revision rates due to micromotion at the taper junction. In order to minimize this risk, one potential solution is to establish an adhesive bond between the metal taper junctions. Load-stable bonding techniques, already successfully employed in dentistry for connecting materials such as metals and ceramics or different alloys, offer a promising approach. Nevertheless, the bond strength of tapered adhesive bonds in modular hip implants has not been investigated to date. Twenty-eight tapered junctions, consisting of a taper (female taper) and a trunnion (male taper) were turned using TiAl6V4 ELI (n = 16) and CoCr28Mo6 (n = 12). The process parameters cutting speed (vc = 50 m/min or 100 m/min) and feed (f = 0.1 mm, 0.05 mm or 0.2 mm) were varied for the trunnions. For each set of process parameters, one trunnion and one taper were additionally subjected to sandblasting. To investigate the effect of geometry, angular mismatch in the samples were measured. The taper pairs were bonded with a biocompatible adhesive, and push-out tests were subsequently performed. The push-out forces generated from the taper connections where both tapers were sandblasted showed a mean push-out force of 5.70 kN. For the samples with only the trunnion sandblasted, the mean force was 0.58 kN, while for the samples with only taper sandblasted the mean push-out force was 1.32 kN. When neither of the tapers was sandblasted the mean push-out force was 0.91 kN. No significant effect of the process parameters on the push-out force was observed. Only the reduced valley depth Svk showed a slight correlation for the CoCr28Mo6 samples (R2 = 0.54). The taper pairs with taper mismatch (between trunnion and taper) greater than |0.1°| did not show lower push-out forces than the specimens with lower taper mismatch. Sandblasted and adhesive-bonded tapered connections represent a viable suitable alternative for modular hip implant connections. Slight differences in taper geometry do not result in reduced push-out forces and are compensated by the adhesive. In mechanically joined tapers these differences can lead to higher wear rates. Further investigation under realistic test conditions is necessary to assess long-term suitability.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39933608', 'title': 'Follicle-stimulating hormone peptide-conjugated liposomes in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer through the induction of M2-to-M1 macrophage repolarization.', 'abstract': 'The silent killer epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a lethal malignancy with high mortality rate and often diagnosed at an advanced stage.

An ISO14040/44 standardized life cycle assessment was conducted for the functional unit of an individual patient trajectory of elective coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, from operating room admission until intensive care unit discharge. Data were collected for products, processes, and services required for care delivery in a Dutch academic hospital for 12 patients. The environmental impact was calculated using the ReCiPe 2016 method. A single patient trajectory caused 414 [IQR 383-461] kgCO2 equivalents of global warming, equal to 2753 km of driving an average Dutch petrol-fuelled car. Other notable environmental impacts were fine particulate matter, (non-)carcinogenic toxicity, land use, and terrestrial acidification. Operating room disposable products (162 kgCO2eq), energy use (48 kgCO2eq), and employee commute (36 kgCO2eq) contributed most to global warming. The extracorporeal circulation set, surgical drapes, intraoperative salvage set, surgical gowns, and cotton gauzes caused most of the disposables' environmental impact. Most energy use occurred in the operating room via heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. A coronary artery bypass grafting trajectory's environmental impact primarily contributed to global warming. Most impact mitigation could be achieved by avoiding/reducing disposable product use when possible or replacing these with reusables. Optimizing operating room energy systems, switching to renewable energy, and encouraging low-emission employee commute can further reduce the environmental impact.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40101120', 'title': 'Revealing the Folding of Single-Chain Polymeric Nanoparticles at the Atomistic Scale by Combining Computational Modeling and X-ray Scattering.', 'abstract': \"Predicting 3D structures of synthetic heterograft polymers in solution starting from a chemical structure remains a great challenge.

The intestinal microbiome and immune response play pivotal roles in disease progression. Advances in molecular therapies and early interventions have reduced surgery rates; however, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant concern, driven by chronic inflammation. In UC, the risk of UC-associated neoplasia (UCAN) increases with disease duration, while CD patients face elevated risks of small intestine, anal fistula, and anal canal cancers. Endoscopic surveillance is advised for UCAN, but optimal screening intervals remain undefined, and no established guidelines exist for CD-associated cancers. UCAN morphology often complicates detection due to its flat, inflammation-blended appearance, which differs pathologically from sporadic CRC (sCRC). UCAN is frequently surrounded by dysplasia, with p53 mutations evident at the dysplasia stage. IBD-associated gastrointestinal cancers exemplify inflammation-driven carcinogenesis with distinct molecular mechanisms from the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. This review explores the epidemiology, risk factors, clinical and pathological features, current surveillance practices, and molecular pathways underlying inflammation-associated cancers in IBD.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35767536', 'title': 'The impact of engaging leadership on employee engagement and team effectiveness: A longitudinal, multi-level study on the mediating role of personal- and team resources.', 'abstract': \"Most research on the effect of leadership behavior on employees' well-being and organizational outcomes is based on leadership frameworks that are not rooted in sound psychological theories of motivation and are limited to either an individual or organizational levels of analysis. The current paper investigates whether individual and team resources explain the impact of engaging leadership on work engagement and team effectiveness, respectively. Data were collected at two time points on N = 1,048 employees nested within 90 work teams. The Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling results revealed that personal resources (i.e., optimism, resiliency, self-efficacy, and flexibility) partially mediated the impact of T1 individual perceptions of engaging leadership on T2 work engagement. Furthermore, joint perceptions of engaging leadership among team members at T1 resulted in greater team effectiveness at T2. This association was fully mediated by team resources (i.e., performance feedback, trust in management, communication, and participation in decision-making). Moreover, team resources had a significant cross-level effect on individual levels of engagement. In practical terms, training and supporting leaders who inspire, strengthen, and connect their subordinates could significantly improve employees' motivation and involvement and enable teams to pursue their common goals successfully.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40270667', 'title': 'Temporomandibular Joint Dislocation After Long-Term Mechanical Ventilation.', 'abstract': 'Dislocations of the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) are relatively common and occur in as many as 7% of the entire population at some point in their lives.

Gram-negative iron-reducing bacteria like Geobacter and Shewanella have been widely studied due to their strong extracellular electron transfer capabilities. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus and Clostridium are often labeled as weak exoelectrogens, leading to their contributions being overlooked. But could their role in iron reduction have been underestimated? To explore this, we enriched paddy soils with glucose, resulting in a predominance of Gram-positive bacteria (e.g., Clostridiaceae and Bacillaceae) and a small presence of Gram-negative reducers (e.g., Geobacteraceae). Remarkably, despite the abundance of Gram-positive iron reducers being 880 times higher in the glucose system, their iron reduction rate was comparable to that of acetate and lactate systems with more Gram-negative bacteria. This suggests a significant contribution by Gram-positive bacteria to iron reduction. Pure culture experiments further revealed that the iron reduction rates of Bacillus and Clostridium are 15.4 and 4.0 times slower, respectively, than a Gram-negative reducer, Geobacter. However, even in natural paddy soil of this study, Gram-positive iron reducers are 9 times more abundant than Gram-negative ones. This gives us an unexpected insight: Considering both abundance and rate, Gram-positive weak exoelectrogens may actually contribute significantly to iron reduction.

For this purpose, oleogel-based emulsions were prepared using 2%, 3.5%, and 5% w/w wax in oleogel and characterized using several physicochemical techniques in order to evaluate the potential of these materials to develop products with functionality similar to commercial margarines. The total wax esters content of RW was similar to that of the CW and was mainly composed of wax esters with more than 44 carbon atoms (crystallizable waxes). Polarized light and scanning electron microscopy showed that RW produced emulsions with more intricate crystalline networks composed of smaller platelets than CW. The melting enthalpy was greater in CW emulsions than RW emulsions, which was in agreement with the thermal behavior found for CW and RW. The oil binding capacity of CW oleogel emulsions was higher than the RW ones, and this property improved with the increase in wax concentration. Likewise, the elastic behavior, as well as hardness and adhesiveness, increased with the wax content as a result of a greater amount of microstructural elements composing the network of these semisolid materials. The oleogel emulsions stability was monitored for 2 months at room temperature. The increase of CW concentration slowed down the coalescence process, but this behavior was not observed for RW emulsions. Obtained results demonstrated that RW oleogel emulsions have the potential to replace the functionality of soft spreadable products.

There was no statistical difference between the first RSA or second RSA and the control group regarding age, gender, or follow-up. No group differences were noted preoperatively for shoulder function scores or mobility (P > .10). All groups significantly improved on all shoulder function scores (Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Western Ontario Osteoarthritis of the Shoulder index, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score) and mobility at final follow-up (all P < .01). There were no significant differences in shoulder function scores or mobility between the first and second RSA in the bilateral group or between either shoulder in the bilateral group and the unilateral group (all P > .10).

About 4300 health-care facilities operate in Ukraine. Funding for new water and sanitation infrastructure, as well as operating and maintaining existing services, is likely inadequate. After implementation, the average WASH FIT score increased from 66 out of a maximum of 100 (range: 57-73) to 83 (range: 69-93).

All anatomical structures and related pathologies should be examined. A 41-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Room complaining of limited mouth opening, severe pain that was worse on chewing, and swelling over her right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) that had started 3 days previously. Physical examination revealed localized swelling and redness over her right TMJ. Her right masticatory muscles were very painful and tender on palpation. Mouth opening was slightly limited. A computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a collection adjacent to her right TMJ, and reactive arthritis was diagnosed. Aspiration and arthrocentesis were performed, leading to immediate improvement. When symptoms returned 6 months later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a cystic lesion adjacent to the TMJ. Under general anesthesia an excisional biopsy was performed, and the pathologic examination revealed fibrous connective tissue with pseudocyst-like formation compatible with ganglion cyst. This case report demonstrates that a CT scan might lead to an incorrect diagnosis, whereas MRI scanning led to the correct diagnosis, thereby emphasizing the importance of choosing the right imaging modality. When a pathologic process of the TMJ is suspected, MRI is the gold standard imaging modality to diagnose the exact TMJ pathology.

Excitability testing is superior for use in normal behaving animals, because this methodology bypasses the technically challenging intra-axonal recording. However, use of excitability testing on the muscle or joint afferent in intact animals presents its own technical challenges. Because these afferents, in many cases, are mixed with motor axons in the peripheral nervous system, it is crucial to dissociate antidromic volleys in the primary afferents from orthodromic volleys in the motor axon, both of which are evoked by intraspinal microstimulation. We have demonstrated in rats that application of a paired stimulation protocol with a short interstimulus interval (ISI) successfully dissociated the antidromic volley in the nerve innervating the medial gastrocnemius muscle. By using a 2-ms ISI, the amplitude of the volleys evoked by the second stimulation was decreased in dorsal root-sectioned rats, but the amplitude did not change or was slightly increased in ventral root-sectioned rats. Excitability testing in rats with intact spinal roots indicated that the putative antidromic volleys exhibited dominant primary afferent depolarization, which was reasonably induced from the more dorsal side of the spinal cord. We concluded that excitability testing with a paired-pulse protocol can be used for studying presynaptic inhibition of somatosensory afferents in animals with intact spinal roots.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26817033', 'title': 'Upregulation of the Purinergic Receptor Subtype P2X3 in the Trigeminal Ganglion Is Involved in Orofacial Pain Induced by Occlusal Interference in Rats.', 'abstract': 'To evaluate whether the purinergic receptor subtype P2X3 (P2X3R) in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons is involved in hyperalgesia of the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) and masseter muscles associated with placement of an occlusal interference.

The expression of P2X3R in the TGs was investigated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Retrograde tracing was combined with immunofluorescence to identify TMJ and masseter muscle afferent neurons in the TGs of six premature rats. The TMJ and masseter muscle MPTs were decreased after placement of the occlusal interference, and the P2X3R antagonist reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia that was caused by the occlusal interference placement. The frequency of P2X3R-immunoreactive cells increased in small-sized neurons in the TG after occlusal interference. By contrast, there was no increase in medium-sized TG neurons. P2X3R mRNA increased on day 3. Retrograde tracing indicated that the TMJ and masseter muscle afferent neurons in the TG expressed P2X3R.

While various dementia-related losses in cognitive functioning are its hallmark clinical symptoms, ultimate diagnosis is based on manual neuropathological assessments using various schemas, including Braak staging, CERAD (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease) and Thal phase scoring. Since these scoring systems are based on subjective assessment, there is inevitably some degree of variation between readers, which could affect ultimate neuropathology diagnosis. Here, we report a pilot study investigating the applicability of computer-driven image analysis for characterizing neuropathological features, as well as its potential to supplement or even replace manually derived ratings commonly performed in medical settings. In this work, we quantitatively measured amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque in various brain regions from 34 patients using a robust digital quantification algorithm. We next verified these digitally derived measures to the manually derived pathology ratings using correlation and ordinal logistic regression methods, while also investigating the association with other AD-related neuropathology scoring schema commonly used at autopsy, such as Braak and CERAD. In addition to successfully verifying our digital measurements of Aβ plaques with respective categorical measurements, we found significant correlations with most AD-related scoring schemas. Our results demonstrate the potential for digital analysis to be adapted to more complex staining procedures commonly used in neuropathological diagnosis. As the efficiency of scanning and digital analysis of histology images increases, we believe that the basis of our semi-automatic approach may better standardize quantification of neuropathological changes and AD diagnosis, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of neurological disorders and more efficient patient care.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38876480', 'title': 'Could synovial fluid be a useful substrate for the forensic analysis of diatoms?', 'abstract': 'To date, synovial fluid has not been the subject of targeted analysis as a possible substrate to search for the presence of diatoms in the forensic context of drowning.

After a thin smear of the supernatant was obtained from the centrifugation of the synovial fluid sample, diatoms were successfully detected, consistent with those found in other organs and the water of the canal. The detection of diatoms in the synovial fluid was an objective finding, but its generalizability is limited because this was a pilot application.

Glucose hypometabolism and glial activation are pathological features seen in AD brains; however, the connection between the two is not fully understood. Using a Drosophila model of AD, we identified that glucose metabolism in glia plays a critical role in neuroinflammation under disease conditions. Expression of human MATP (hereafter referred to as Tau) in the retinal cells, including photoreceptor neurons and pigment glia, causes photoreceptor degeneration accompanied by the formation of dark-stained round inclusion-like structures and swelling of the lamina cortex. We found that inclusion-like structures are formed by glial phagocytosis, and swelling of the laminal cortex correlates with the expression of antimicrobial peptides. Coexpression of human glucose transporter 3 (SLC2A3, hereafter referred to as GLUT3) with Tau in the retina does not affect Tau levels but suppresses these inflammatory responses and photoreceptor degeneration. We also found that expression of GLUT3, specifically in the pigment glia, is sufficient to suppress inflammatory phenotypes and mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in the Tau-expressing retina.

The S-Oxiracetam and Oxiracetam were primarily eliminated through urine in their original form, with cumulative excretion rates of 92.16% and 85.92%, respectively, within 24\\xa0h after administration. Enantiomers interconversion was not observed in the plasma, urine, or feces. The results of this study suggest that replacing 4\\xa0g Oxiracetam injection with 2\\xa0g S-Oxiracetam injection could offer clinical benefits by lowering the dosage and mitigating potential risks, based on the pharmacokinetic characteristics.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40075552', 'title': 'An Inferential Investigation Into Countermovement Jump Determinants of Ulnar Collateral Ligament Injuries in Collegiate Baseball Pitchers.', 'abstract': 'Countermovement jump (CMJ) analyses can predict ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) injuries in professional baseball pitchers, yet a biomechanical determinant linking CMJ analytics to UCL sprains is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate CMJ parameters in collegiate pitchers with high and low elbow varus torque (EVT) and investigate multilinear regression relationships between CMJ and EVT kinetics. It was hypothesized that pitchers with greater EVT would have greater CMJ measures, and CMJ kinetics would explain the variance in EVT kinetics. Descriptive laboratory study. Analyses of 19 Division I collegiate baseball pitchers (age, 19.9 ± 1.5 years; body height, 1.87 ± 0.08 m; body mass, 90.0 ± 13.4 kg) were performed with integrated ball release speed, 3-dimensional motion capture, and ground reaction force (GRF) technology. A 1-way between-participant analysis of variance was used to compare CMJ and ball velocity metrics, while Pearson correlations ( The EVT rate of torque development (EVTRTD) was significantly greater in pitchers with a higher EVT (high EVT: 605 ± 74 vs low EVT: 353 ± 103 N·m·s Compared with absolute EVT, CMJ kinetics were more associated with the rate of EVT in collegiate pitchers. Therefore, as it relates to injury surveillance, identifying pitchers who display increases in peak GRF, concentric impulse, and peak CMJ power may provide early detection in protecting athletes from elbow valgus overload.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167902', 'title': 'A Data-Driven Volitional EMG Extraction Algorithm During Functional Electrical Stimulation With Time Variant Parameters.', 'abstract': 'The goal of this study is to design a novel approach for extracting volitional electromyography (vEMG) contaminated by functional electrical stimulation (FES) with time variant amplitudes and frequencies. A selective interpolation (SI) is adopted to eliminate the initial spike. Then the interpolated signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions by using complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). Each IMF is window-filtered based on a logistic regression (LR) classifier to identify the IMFs contaminated by FES. Semi-simulated signals were generated using EMG and stimulation response and three metrics were adopted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, including the a) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), b) normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and c) cross-correlation coefficient between the clean EMG and the extracted EMG. Real FES-contaminated EMG was collected from six able bodied volunteers and one stroke patient. The correlation coefficients between the extracted EMG and the wrist torque were analyzed. The simulation results showed a higher SNR (2.12 to -2.13dB), higher correlation (0.88± 0.08) and lower NRMSE (0.78 to 1.29) than those of the comb filter and EMD-Notch algorithm. The EMG-Torque correlation coefficients were 0.75± 0.07 for monopolar pulses and 0.77± 0.12 for bipolar pulses. For the stroke patient, the algorithm also successfully extracted underlying vEMG from time variant FES noises. All results showed that SICEEMDAN-LR is capable of extracting EMG during FES with time-variant parameters.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40264505', 'title': 'Evaluating the Feasibility and Effectiveness of an Interdisciplinary Verbal De-Escalation and Implicit Bias Check Training for Agitation Management in the Emergency Department.', 'abstract': 'Recent scholarship has revealed racial disparities in emergency department (ED) physical restraint use in agitation management. We implemented an interdisciplinary educational program that integrates discussions about the role of bias in physical restraint use with workplace violence (WPV) prevention strategies to increase awareness of implicit bias and comfort with verbal de-escalation among ED staff. In partnership with hospital security at a large urban academic medical center, we developed a 1-hour online WPV prerequisite course followed by a 2-hour multi-modal, in-person training consisting of 40\\xa0minutes each of didactics, an interactive defensive skills workshop, and case-based simulations with structured debriefings. From September 2022 to June 2023, all patient-facing ED staff were invited to participate and received a $100 gift card for program completion. Participants rated their confidence and comfort in various aspects of agitation management on a 5-point Likert scale before and immediately after via pre- and post-training surveys. Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests were employed for analysis. Of 91 participants, 72 (79%) completed the pre- and post-training surveys. Representing a wide range of ED role groups, 74% of participants were clinical staff and a majority had 0-5 years of experience (65%). Among all participants, there was a statistically significant improvement in confidence and comfort with the various aspects of agitation management across all 11 questions (p<0.001). A similar change was observed among the clinical staff (p<0.001), however, the degree of improvement observed among those with greater than 5 years of experience was less dramatic than among clinical staff with 0-5 years of experience. Interdisciplinary multi-modal training can improve confidence and comfort with verbal de-escalation and implicit bias checks in team-based agitation management. Additional research is needed to understand if such integrated training can also reduce physical restraint use, racial disparities in restraint use, and WPV events.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40115780', 'title': 'Research progress on the kidney-gut-brain axis in brain dysfunction in maintenance hemodialysis patients.', 'abstract': 'Maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) has become the primary renal replacement therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the prevalence of these brain disorders in MHD patients. Understanding the mechanisms of brain disorders in MHD patients, particularly through the lens of kidney-gut-brain axis dysfunction, offers valuable insights for future research and the development of targeted therapies.

Advances in minimally invasive techniques, including percutaneous pedicle screw fixation and mini-open anterolateral retractor-based approaches can improve surgical outcomes when appropriately applied by reducing blood loss, operative duration and post-operative pain. Moreover, they allow for theoretical advantages by preservation of muscular and skeletal blood supply and innervation that is typically lost during the muscular dissection of open approaches. For thoracolumbar spine fractures, percutaneous fixation allows for internal bracing of unstable fractures during healing while maintaining sagittal alignment. In instances of neurological compromise from fracture retropulsion, corpectomies may be required, and mini-open lateral approaches adopted from degenerative disease applications allow for a minimally invasive manner to treat the defect. These further allow for placement of wide rectangular-footprint expandable vertebral body replacement devices to provide anterior column support. We believe this allows for lower rates of subsidence and helps to maintain the biomechanical integrity necessary to prevent post-traumatic malalignment and kyphosis. Together, these minimally invasive techniques combined supply the spine surgeon with a minimally invasive armamentarium to treat nearly all thoracolumbar spine trauma. Surgeons should be comfortable with the strengths and shortcomings of these approaches in order to successfully apply them for this pathology.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40298094', 'title': 'Design of Coamorphous Systems for Flavonoid Components Coformed with Meglumine by Integrating Theory-Model-Experiment Techniques.', 'abstract': 'Flavonoids represent an extensive group of phenolic substances in vegetables, fruits, grains, tea, flowers, etc., which show a variety of biological activities in various nutraceutical, cosmetic, and medicinal fields. Despite demonstrating multifunctional bioactive properties relevant to nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications, their clinical utilization faces challenges due to their generally low water solubility. This study established a systematic methodology combining computational modeling and experimental validation for developing flavonoid-meglumine (MEG) coamorphous formulations. The initial screening identified 13 flavonoid compounds exhibiting favorable miscibility with MEG from 15 candidates through Hansen solubility parameter analysis. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations revealed potential hydrogen bond formation in six selected flavonoids (BAI, HES, NAR, KAE, QUE, and ISO) with MEG. Then, six flavonoid coamorphous systems were successfully prepared via the melt-quenching method and characterized by PLM, PXRD, and differential scanning calorimetry. FTIR and radial distribution function analysis results collectively confirmed intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions within these binary systems. In vitro dissolution studies revealed significant solubility/dissolution enhancement in both pH 1.2 HCl and pH 6.8 phosphate buffers, maintaining long-term supersaturation for all six coamorphous formulations. Meanwhile, six flavonoid coamorphous systems had superior stability over individual flavonoid amorphous components, which were attributed to the stronger intermolecular interactions by higher binding energy calculation. These results indicated that the obtained flavonoid coamorphous systems performed a promising application potential in functional products. Importantly, this study presents a novel design framework integrating computational prediction, molecular modeling, and experimental validation for systematic screening of flavonoid coamorphous formulations.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36628428', 'title': \"Current Status and Future Perspectives on Stem Cell-Based Therapies for Parkinson's Disease.\", 'abstract': \"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease, affecting 1%-2% of the population over the age of 65. As the population ages, it is anticipated that the burden on society will significantly escalate. Although symptom reduction by currently available pharmacological and/or surgical treatments improves the quality of life of many PD patients, there are no treatments that can slow down, halt, or reverse disease progression. Because the loss of a specific cell type, midbrain dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, is the main cause of motor dysfunction in PD, it is considered a promising target for cell replacement therapy. Indeed, numerous preclinical and clinical studies using fetal cell transplantation have provided proof of concept that cell replacement therapy may be a viable therapeutic approach for PD. However, the use of human fetal cells remains fraught with controversy due to fundamental ethical, practical, and clinical limitations. Groundbreaking work on human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including human embryonic stem cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells, coupled with extensive basic research in the stem cell field offers promising potential for hPSC-based cell replacement to become a realistic treatment regimen for PD once several major issues can be successfully addressed. In this review, we will discuss the prospects and challenges of hPSC-based cell therapy for PD.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36972778', 'title': 'Influence of lipid composition of messenger RNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles on the protein expression via intratracheal administration in mice.', 'abstract': 'Intratracheal (i.t.) administration, which takes advantage of the specific structure of the respiratory system, can effectively deliver nanoparticles to the lung.

We first validated higher protein expression with mRNA-LNP compared to that with mRNA-PEI complex and naked mRNA. Then, we evaluated the influence of lipid composition of LNPs on the protein expression and found that: 1) decreasing the PEG molarity from 1.5% to 0.5% could significantly increase the protein expression; 2) replacing DMG-PEG with DSG-PEG could slightly increase the protein expression; 3) using DOPE instead of DSPC could increase protein expression by an order of magnitude.

Participants requiring replacement of single missing posterior teeth with implant-supported crowns were randomly allocated into 2 treatment groups: narrow (3.3 mm) or standard (4.1 mm) diameter implant. All implants were restored with screw-retained monolithic zirconia crowns. The changes in marginal bone level (MBL) were assessed at the time of delivery of definitive crown and after 1 year of function. Implant stability was measured at placement, 3 and 12 months. Implant success, pink esthetic score (PES), peri-implant parameters, and patient satisfaction were also evaluated. A total of 20 participants with 20 implant-supported single crowns completed the 1-year follow-up. All implants were successful. The narrow diameter implants had a higher bone remodeling of 0.39 ± 0.92 mm after 1 year of loading compared with only 0.10 ± 0.29 mm for the standard diameter implants but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .40). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 implant groups in terms of PES and peri-implant outcomes. Narrow and standard-diameter TiZr implants supporting screw-retained monolithic zirconia crowns in the posterior region were reliable treatment modalities with comparable clinical, radiographic and patient reported outcomes after 1 year of function. Patient satisfaction was high in both treatment groups.
