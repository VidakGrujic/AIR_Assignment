The authors define target zones for this approach and describe a series of cases with detailed measurements of visual outcomes, including those obtained with exophthalmometry. The authors performed a retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of LTOA patients. Seven target zones were identified: 1) the orbit, 2) the lesser sphenoid wing and anterior clinoid, 3) the middle fossa, 4) the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus and Meckel's cave, 5) the infratemporal fossa, 6) the petrous apex, and 7) the anterior fossa. The authors used volumetric analyses of preoperative and postoperative MR and CT imaging data to calculate the volume of bone and tumor removed and to provide detailed ophthalmological, neurological, and cosmetic outcomes. Of the 20 patients in this cohort, pathology was in zone 2 (n = 10), zone 4 (n = 6), zone 3 (n = 2), zone 1 (n = 1), and zone 5 (n = 1). Pathology was meningioma (n = 10), schwannoma (n = 2), metastasis (n = 2), epidermoid (n = 1), dermoid (n = 1), encephalocele (n = 1), adenoma (n = 1), glioblastoma (n = 1), and inflammatory lesion (n = 1). The goal was gross-total resection (GTR) in 9 patients, all of whom achieved GTR. Subtotal resection (STR) was the goal in 8 patients (5 spheno-orbital meningiomas, 1 giant cavernous sinus/Meckel's cave schwannoma, 1 cavernous sinus prolactinoma, and 1 cavernous sinus dermoid), 7 of whom achieved STR and 1 of whom achieved GTR. The goal was biopsy in 2 patient and repair of encephalocele in 1. Visual acuity was stable or improved in 18 patients and worse in 2. Transient early postoperative diplopia, ptosis, eyelid swelling, and peri-orbital numbness were common. All 9 patients with preoperative diplopia improved at their last follow-up. Seven of 8 patients with preoperative exophthalmos improved after surgery (average correction of 64%). There were no cases of clinically significant (> 2 mm) postoperative enophthalmos. The most frequent postoperative complaint was peri-orbital numbness (40%). There was 1 CSF leak. Most patients were satisfied with their ocular (84%-100% of patients provided positive satisfaction-related responses) and cosmetic (75%-100%) outcomes. The LTOA is a safe minimal access approach to a variety of paramedian anterior skull base pathologies in several locations.

However, the interaction between neuronal activity and the immune microenvironment in glioblastoma (GBM) remains largely unclear. By applying chemogenetic techniques, we enhanced and inhibited neuronal activity in vitro and in a mouse model to study how neuronal activity regulates microglial polarization and affects GBM progression. We demonstrate that hypoxia drove glioma stem cells (GSC) to produce higher levels of glutamate, which activated local neurons. Neuronal activity promoted GBM progression by facilitating microglial M2 polarization through enriching miR-200c-3p in neuron-derived exosomes, which decreased the expression of the m6A writer zinc finger CCCH-type containing 13 (ZC3H13) in microglia, impairing methylation of dual specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9) mRNA. Downregulation of DUSP9 promoted ERK pathway activation, which subsequently induced microglial M2 polarization. In the mouse model, cortical neuronal activation promoted microglial M2 polarization whereas cortical neuronal inhibition decreased microglial M2 polarization in GBM xenografts. miR-200c-3p knockdown in cortical neurons impaired microglial M2 polarization and GBM xenograft growth, even when cortical neurons were activated. Treatment with the anti-seizure medication levetiracetam impaired neuronal activation and subsequently reduced neuron-mediated microglial M2 polarization. These findings indicated that hypoxic GSC-induced neuron activation promotes GBM progression by polarizing microglia via the exosomal miR-200c-3p/ZC3H13/DUSP9/p-ERK pathway. Levetiracetam, an antiepileptic drug, blocks the abnormal activation of neurons in GBM and impairs activity-dependent GBM progression.

It occurs via phenotypic plasticity, that is, changes in gene expression derived from changes in the physiological environment. This phenomenon is important in many biological processes, in particular in cancer evolution and its treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms behind it. Specifically, the emergence of the cancer stem cell phenotype, showing enhanced proliferation and invasion rates, is an essential process in tumour progression. We present a mathematical framework to simulate phenotypic heterogeneity in different cell populations as a result of their interaction with chemical species in their microenvironment, through a continuum model using the well-known concept of internal variables to model cell phenotype. The resulting model, derived from conservation laws, incorporates the relationship between the phenotype and the history of the stimuli to which cells have been subjected, together with the inheritance of that phenotype. To illustrate the model capabilities, it is particularised for glioblastoma adaptation to hypoxia. A parametric analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of each model parameter regulating cellular adaptation, showing that it permits reproducing different trends reported in the scientific literature. The framework can be easily adapted to any particular problem of cell plasticity, with the main limitation of having enough cells to allow working with continuum variables. With appropriate calibration and validation, it could be useful for exploring the underlying processes of cellular adaptation, as well as for proposing favourable/unfavourable conditions or treatments.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37986881', 'title': 'Distinct functions of wild-type and R273H mutant Δ133p53α differentially regulate glioblastoma aggressiveness and therapy-induced senescence.', 'abstract': \"Mutations effects on p53 isoforms' activities remain largely unknown, although they are mutated in 92% of \"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39225815', 'title': 'Multicenter investigation of preoperative distinction between primary central nervous system lymphomas and glioblastomas through interpretable artificial intelligence models.', 'abstract': 'Research into the effectiveness and applicability of deep learning, radiomics, and their integrated models based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for preoperative differentiation between Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) and Glioblastoma (GBM), along with an exploration of the interpretability of these models.

Baseline QoL scores were compared with corresponding scores from a historical HGG cohort. Summary QoL scores were compared longitudinally over time by related samples Friedman's two-way test. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and reported as 1-year estimates with 95% confidence intervals. Forty-nine (89%) of 55 patients completed the planned course of hypofractionated radiotherapy. Longitudinal QoL data were available in 42 (86%) of 49 patients completing radiotherapy, comprising the present cohort.

Baseline QoL scores were significantly worse for several domains compared with a historical institutional cohort of HGG patients treated previously with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, indicating negative selection bias. QoL scores remained stable for most domains after palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy, with statistically significant improvements in fatigue (P = 0.032), dyspnoea (P = 0.042) and motor dysfunction (P = 0.036) over time.

Specifically, we show that a relative softening of treated compared to untreated tumors is linked to the inflammatory processes following therapy-induced re-education of tumor-associated myeloid cells. Mechanistically, combined effects of myeloid influx and inflammation including extracellular matrix degradation following immunotherapy form the basis of treated tumors being softer than untreated glioma.

Notch signaling has been associated with tumorigenesis and cell survival, potentially driving the pathogenesis of GBM. The current study aims to determine whether 2OHOA modulates the Notch pathway as part of its antitumoral mechanism. 2OHOA's effect was evaluated on different components of the pathway by Western blot, Q-PCR, and confocal microscopy. Notch receptor processing was analyzed by subcellular fractionation and colocalization studies. Furin activity was evaluated under cleavage of its substrate by fluorescence assays and its binding affinity to 2OHOA was determined by surface plasmon resonance. We found that 2OHOA inhibits Notch2 and Notch3 signaling by dual mechanism. Notch2 inhibition is unleashed by impairment of its processing through the inactivation of furin activity by physical association. Instead, Notch3 is transcriptionally downregulated leading to a lower activation of the pathway.

In the present manuscript, six GBM- and two GS-derived SLGC lines were analyzed for their responsiveness to RAR- and RXR-selective agonists. Inhibition of proliferation and initiation of differentiation were achieved with a RAR-selective pan-agonist in a subgroup of SLGC lines, whereas RXR-selective pan-agonists (rexinoids) supported proliferation in most SLGC lines. To decipher the RAR-dependent and RAR-independent effects of RXR, the genes encoding the RAR or RXR isotypes were functionally inactivated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing in an IDH1-/p53-positive SLGC line with good responsiveness to RA. Stemness, differentiation capacity, and growth behavior were preserved after editing. Taken together, this manuscript provides evidence about the positive impact of RAR-independent RXR signaling on proliferation, survival, and tumor metabolism in SLGCs.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37441593', 'title': 'Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies critical transcription factors of tumor cell invasion induced by hypoxia microenvironment in glioblastoma.', 'abstract': ''}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40269908', 'title': 'Oxidative stress induced paclitaxel-derived carbon dots inhibit glioblastoma proliferation and EMT process.', 'abstract': 'Glioblastoma represents the most prevalent and deadly form of brain tumor with limited therapeutic drugs.

In this study, we report the synthesis of a novel carbon dots, PTX-CDs, using a one-step hydrothermal method with paclitaxel (PTX) as the precursor. PTX-CDs shows increased water solubility by about 1000 times in comparison with PTX. Moreover, PTX-CDs effectively penetrates the BBB and exerts significant anticancer effects. In detail, PTX-CDs accumulates in mitochondria of tumor cells without adding extra targeted molecules, resulting in the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Transcriptome profiling revealed that PTX-CDs disturbs the cell-cycle by inducing arrest at the G2/M phase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. PTX-CDs further decreased cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in glioblastoma cells.

Entry factors for ZIKV are incompletely understood, but phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors, including the TAM (Tyro3, AXL, and Mer) and TIM (T-cell Ig mucin) families, can serve as cofactors for flavivirus entry in a cell type-specific manner. We identify AXL as the top hit in a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screen in human glioblastoma cells and establish a definitive role of AXL, but not TYRO3 or MerTK, for ZIKV infection. Additionally, Spondweni virus also shows AXL dependency, while dengue virus infection is not affected by AXL knockout. Passage of ZIKV in AXL knockout (KO) cells generated a mutant virus capable of infection via AXL-independent mechanisms, and multiple independent selections identified a common mutation, H83R, in the prM coding region of the ZIKV genome. The mutant virus exhibits an increased infectivity rate in AXL KO cells as compared to wild-type ZIKV and is dependent upon the single H83R mutation. The mutant virus' ability to infect cells in an AXL-independent manner is unrelated to interferon signaling antagonism but likely pertains to a change in virus maturation that leads to a structural disturbance of the ZIKV virion. Our study provides evidence for a potential mechanism linking the viral structural proteins and host PS receptor usage during flavivirus infection.IMPORTANCEA major challenge in elucidating the mechanism of Zika virus (ZIKV) pathogenesis is the multitude of cell types it infects with distinct requirements. The role of phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors in ZIKV infection is cell type-specific, and the controversy surrounds their function in flavivirus entry. Here, we establish a definitive requirement of AXL for infection of human glioblastoma cells by both Zika and Spondweni virus. We then identified a single amino acid mutation (H83R) in the prM protein of ZIKV that allowed AXL-independent infection of these cells. The H83R-mediated escape of AXL requirement is independent of interferon (IFN) signaling suppression by AXL; instead, the mutation has the potential to disrupt the virus assembly and virion structure. This study reveals a previously unknown connection between the PS receptor usage and the flavivirus prM gene, which can guide detailed molecular mechanism studies of the interplay between virion assembly and virus entry.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36828374', 'title': 'Labeling T Cells to Track Immune Response to Immunotherapy in Glioblastoma.', 'abstract': 'While the advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, its use in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) has been less successful.

For the validation process, a data set composed of MRI rat brain scans was evaluated: i) healthy animals, ii) temporal blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, iii) cerebral chronic hypoperfusion (CCH), iv) ischemic stroke, and v) glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) models. The resulting perfusion parameters were then compared with data retrieved from the literature. A total of 30 animals were evaluated with our DSC-MRI quantification tool. In all the models, the hemodynamic parameters reported from the literature are reproduced and they are in the same range as our results. The Bland-Altman plot used to describe the agreement between our perfusion quantitative analyses and literature data regarding healthy rats, stroke, and GBM models, determined that the agreement for CBV and MTT is higher than for CBF.

Unlike many cancers, gliomas rarely metastasize outside the brain, indicating a possible dependency on unique features of brain microenvironment. Synapses between neurons and glioma cells exist, suggesting that glioma cells rely on neuronal inputs and synaptic signaling for proliferation. Yet, the locations and properties of neurons that innervate gliomas have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized transsynaptic tracing with a pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus to specifically infect TVA and glycoprotein-expressing human glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, allowing us to identify the neurons that form synapses onto the gliomas. Comprehensive whole-brain mapping revealed that these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) consistently arise at brain regions, including diverse neuromodulatory centers and specific cortical layers, known to project to the glioma locations. Molecular profiling revealed that these long-range cortical GINs are predominantly glutamatergic, and subsets express both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, whereas local striatal GINs are largely GABAergic. Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that while GINs share passive intrinsic properties with cortex-innervating neurons, their action potential waveforms are altered. Our study introduces a novel method for identifying and mapping GINs and reveals their consistent integration into existing location-dependent neuronal network involving diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The observed intrinsic electrophysiological differences in GINs lay the groundwork for future investigations into how these alterations may correspond with the postsynaptic characteristics of glioma cells. We have developed a novel system utilizing rabies virus-based monosynaptic tracing to directly visualize neurons that synapse onto human glioma cells implanted in mouse brain. This approach enables the mapping and quantitative analysis of these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) in the entire mouse brain and overcomes previous barriers of molecular and electrophysiological analysis of these neurons due to the inability to identify them. Our findings indicate that GINs integrate into existing neural networks in a location-specific manner. Long-range GINs are mostly glutamatergic, with a subset expressing both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers and local striatal GINs are GABAergic, highlighting a complex neuromodulatory profile. Additionally, GINs exhibit unique action potential characteristics, distinct from similarly selected neurons in non-tumor-bearing brains.

CD317-targeting CAR T cells were generated by lentivirally transducing human T cells from healthy donors. The anti-glioma activity of CD317-CAR T cells toward various glioma cells was assessed in vitro in cell lysis assays.

We focused on three primary parameters: tumor (T), leading-edge (L), and nontumor (N). Cell gating was performed using the Cytobank platform. We calculated the Euclidean distances between cells to determine cellular interactions and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to explore the molecular characteristics and mechanisms underlying specific fibroblast (FB) clusters. scRNA-seq combined with spatial transcriptomics (ST) facilitated the identification of ligand-receptor (L-R) pairs that mediate interactions between specific FB clusters and endothelial cells. Machine learning algorithms were used to construct a prognostic gene signature. The microenvironments in the N, L, and T regions of MIBC exhibited spatial heterogeneity and regional diversity in their components. A distinct FB cluster located in the L region-identified as S3-is strongly associated with poor prognosis. IMC analyses demonstrated a close spatial association between S3 and endothelial cells, with S3-positive tumors exhibiting increased blood vessel density and altered vascular morphology. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and active vascular sprouting were significant in S3-positive tumors. scRNA-seq and ST analyses indicated that the genes upregulated in S3 were associated with angiogenesis.

Meanwhile, the expression pattern of TSPAN7 was verified in glioma clinical samples and glioma cell lines by qPCR, Western Blotting and immunofluorescence.

Additional comparative analysis included prior cohorts, totaling 65 patients. Cox proportional hazards models and meta-analysis were employed to assess p-ERK as a predictive biomarker after immunotherapy. Lower median p-ERK+ cell density was observed compared with prior studies, likely due to variable tissue processing across cohorts.

To explore the mechanisms underlying resistance, we developed two TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines through a gradual increase in TMZ exposure. Transcriptome sequencing of TMZ-resistant cell lines revealed that alterations in histone post-translational modifications might be instrumental in conferring TMZ resistance. Subsequently, multi-omics analysis suggests a strong association between histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) levels and TMZ resistance. We observed a significant correlation between the expression of H3K9ac and MGMT, particularly in the unmethylated MGMT promoter samples. More importantly, our findings suggest that H3K9ac may enhance MGMT transcription by facilitating the recruitment of the SP1 transcription factor to the MGMT transcription factor binding site. Additionally, by analyzing single-cell transcriptomics data from matched primary and recurrent GBM tumors treated with TMZ, we modeled the molecular shifts occurring upon tumor recurrence. We also noted a reduction in tumor stem cell characteristics, accompanied by an increase in H3K9ac, SP1, and MGMT levels, underscoring the potential role of H3K9ac in tumor relapse following TMZ therapy.

Due to the growing need for an effective diagnostic tool before starting immunotherapy methods, such as the CAR-T anti-EGFRvIII or SynNotch CAR-T recognizing EGFRvIII, it is necessary to identify a more reliable and simple method of EGFRvIII detection or improve the specificity of the anti-EGFRvIII antibody, until then, immunocytochemistry may temporarily replace immunohistochemistry.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39103055', 'title': 'Systemically targeting monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells using dendrimers and their cell-level biodistribution kinetics.', 'abstract': 'The focus of nanoparticles in vivo trafficking has been mostly on their tissue-level biodistribution and clearance. Recent progress in the nanomedicine field suggests that the targeting of nanoparticles to immune cells can be used to modulate the immune response and enhance therapeutic delivery to the diseased tissue. In the presence of tumor lesions, monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) expand significantly in the bone marrow, egress into peripheral blood, and traffic to the solid tumor, where they help maintain an immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the interaction between PAMAM dendrimers and M-MDSCs in two murine models of glioblastoma, by examining the cell-level biodistribution kinetics of the systemically injected dendrimers. We found that M-MDSCs in the tumor and lymphoid organs can efficiently endocytose hydroxyl dendrimers. Interestingly, the trafficking of M-MDSCs from the bone marrow to the tumor contributed to the deposition of hydroxyl dendrimers in the tumor. M-MDSCs showed different capacities of endocytosing dendrimers of different functionalities in vivo. This differential uptake was mediated by the unique serum proteins associated with each dendrimer surface functionality. The results of this study set up the framework for developing dendrimer-based immunotherapy to target M-MDSCs for cancer treatment.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38231039', 'title': 'Accuracy of Radiomics in Predicting ', 'abstract': 'Purpose To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the predictive accuracy of radiomics in the noninvasive determination of isocitrate dehydrogenase '}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39996732', 'title': 'Glioblastoma Cell Migration, Invasion and Vasculogenic Mimicry Downmodulated by Novel uPAcyclin Derivatives.', 'abstract': \"Despite extensive efforts to develop new treatments, the prognosis for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is extremely unfavorable, urging the identification of new chemotherapeutics.

In this study, we established a ceRNA network to screen out the potential regulatory pathways involved in the malignant transformation of IDH-mutant astrocytomas. Firstly, the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was employed to compare the expression levels of the differential expressed genes (DEGs) in astrocytomas.

A systematic search was conducted across major medical databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) up to 3 September 2023. The search strategy utilized relevant Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords related to \"glioblastomas,\" \"immunotherapies,\" and \"treatment.\" The studies included in this review consist of randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, and cohort studies reporting on the use of immunotherapies for the treatment of gliomas in human subjects. A total of 1588 papers are initially identified. Eligibility is confirmed for 752 articles, while 655 are excluded for various reasons, including irrelevance to the research topic (627), insufficient method and results details (12), and being case-series or cohort studies (22), systematic literature reviews, or meta-analyses (3). All the studies within the systematic review were clinical trials spanning from 1995 to 2023, involving 6383 patients. Neuro-oncology published the most glioma immunotherapy-related clinical trials (15/97, 16%). Most studies were released between 2018 and 2022, averaging nine publications annually during this period.

Overcoming immunotolerance, stimulating robust tumor antigen responses, and countering immunosuppressive microenvironment mechanisms are critical for curative GBM immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, show promise, with the ongoing research aiming to enhance their effectiveness. Personalized cancer vaccines, especially targeting neoantigens, offer substantial potential. Oncolytic viruses exhibited dual mechanisms and a breakthrough status in the clinical trials.

Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed a strong association of ANGPTL proteins with several tumor-suppressor proteins such as ITGB3, ITGAV, and RASSF5. \\'Gene-expression profiling interactive analysis\\' (GEPIA) showed that expression of ANGPTL3 is significantly downregulated in five cancers: sarcoma (SARC); cholangio carcinoma (CHOL); kidney chromophobe carcinoma (KICH); kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC); and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP). GEPIA also showed that expression of ANGPTL8 remains downregulated in three cancers: CHOL; glioblastoma (GBM); and breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). Survival rate analysis indicated that both upregulation and downregulation of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL8 leads to low survival rates in various types of cancer.

This review provides insights into the therapeutic effects of apigenin and flavonoids with similar structure on glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. Current evidence indicates that apigenin has the unique ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, neurogenic, and neuroprotective effects have made this flavonoid a great option for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, apigenin has low toxicity on normal neuronal cells, while induces cytotoxicity on NS cancer cells via triggering several signal pathways and molecular targets. Anticancer effects of apigenin have been contributed to various mechanisms such as induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibition of migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Although apigenin is a promising pharmaceutical agent, its low bioavailability is an important issue that must be solved before introducing to clinic.

After LAASO screening, the expression values of the 5 differential genes were the sum of LASSO regression coefficients. Survival analysis and ROC curve analysis of anoikis scores were performed using the TCGA training and CGGA validation sets. The prognostic factors were analyzed using Cox regression analysis in GBM. Moreover, CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assay were used to evaluate GBM cell proliferation and migration. Significant differences were observed in the 5-year survival of GBM patients between the two subgroups. Then, our analysis demonstrated that high OCIAD2, FTLP3, IGFBP2, and H19 levels were associated with lower 5-year GBM survival rates, whereas high SFRP2 levels were associated with higher survival rates. Univariate Cox analysis indicated that GBM risk was linked to both anoikis score and grade, while multivariate Cox analysis indicated that GBM risk was associated with both anoikis score and age. Additionally, OCIAD2 was highly expressed in U251MG and T98G cells. Moreover, OCIAD2 silencing inhibited GBM cell proliferation and migration. This study demonstrated the potential of the anoikis-associated gene OCIAD2 as a prognostic biomarker for GBM.

Here, we report that IR-induced senescence of tumor cells counterintuitively spurs GBM recurrence, driven by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). We find that irradiated GBM cell lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) cultures senesce rapidly in a p21-dependent manner. Senescent glioma cells upregulate SASP genes and secrete a panoply of SASP factors, prominently interleukin IL-6, an activator of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. These SASP factors collectively activate the JAK-STAT3 and NF-κB pathways in non-senescent GBM cells, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation and SASP spreading. Transcriptomic analyses of irradiated GBM cells and the TCGA database reveal that the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2), encoded by the BIRC3 gene, is a potential survival factor for senescent glioma cells. Senescent GBM cells not only upregulate BIRC3 but also induce BIRC3 expression and promote radioresistance in non-senescent tumor cells. We find that second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetics targeting cIAP2 act as novel senolytics that trigger apoptosis of senescent GBM cells with minimal toxicity towards normal brain cells. Finally, using both PDX and immunocompetent mouse models of GBM, we show that the SMAC mimetic birinapant, administered as an adjuvant after radiotherapy, can eliminate senescent GBM cells and prevent the emergence of recurrent tumors. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that significant improvement in GBM patient survival may become possible in the clinic by eliminating senescent cells arising after radiotherapy.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40141993', 'title': 'Fabrication and Evaluation of Polyhydroxyalkanoate-Based Nanoparticles for Curcumin Delivery in Biomedical Applications.', 'abstract': \"This study investigates the fabrication and characterization of polymeric nanoparticles based on polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) loaded with curcumin for biomedical applications.

After seven months, abnormal signals were completely resolved on MR images, except for the small and stable enhanced lesion on three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging (3D Gd-T1WI) at the base of the hematoma, which did not change in size for seven months. However, a large gadolinium-enhanced lesion at the left temporal lobe developed 17 months after ICH. He underwent total resection of the lesion and was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He received radiation therapy and temozolomide but died of disseminated recurrence 31 months after ICH. In conclusion, this report presents a didactic case of glioblastoma in which the diagnosis of glioblastoma was delayed 17 months after ICH whereas hemorrhagic-onset glioblastoma was previously considered ruled out in cases in which six months or more have passed after ICH. In order not to overlook these cases, follow-up with 3D Gd-T1WI is essential in the case of suspected tumor-related ICH and close follow-up is recommended when the enhanced lesion does not resolve after a long period even if it does not grow.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37948301', 'title': 'BASHY Dyes Are Highly Efficient Lipid Droplet-Targeting Photosensitizers that Induce Ferroptosis through Lipid Peroxidation.', 'abstract': 'Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent lipid-peroxidation-driven mechanism of cell death and a promising therapeutic target to eradicate cancer cells.

Recent research has shown that the H-ferritin (FTH1) protein, traditionally recognized as an essential iron storage protein, can transport iron to GBM cancer stem cells, reducing their invasion activity. Moreover, the binding of extracellular FTH1 to human GBM tissues, and brain iron delivery in general, has been found to have a sex bias. These observations raise questions, addressed in this study, about whether H-ferritin levels extrinsic to the tumor can affect tumor cell pathways and if this impact is sex-specific. To interrogate the role of systemic H-ferritin in GBM we introduce a mouse model in which H-ferritin levels are genetically manipulated. Mice that were genetically manipulated to be heterozygous for H-ferritin (Fth1+/-) gene expression were orthotopically implanted with a mouse GBM cell line (GL261). Littermate Fth1 +/+ mice were used as controls. The animals were evaluated for survival and the tumors were subjected to RNA sequencing protocols. We analyzed the resulting data utilizing the murine Microenvironment Cell Population (mMCP) method for in silico immune deconvolution. mMCP analysis estimates the abundance of tissue infiltrating immune and stromal populations based on cell-specific gene expression signatures. There was a clear sex bias in survival. Female Fth1+/- mice had significantly poorer survival than control females (Fth1+/+). The Fth1 genetic status did not affect survival in males. The mMCP analysis revealed a significant reduction in T cells and CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell infiltration in the tumors of females with Fth1+/- background as compared to the Fth1+/+. Mast and fibroblast cell infiltration was increased in females and males with Fth1+/- background, respectively, compared to Fth1+/+ mice. Genetic manipulation of Fth1 which leads to reduced systemic levels of FTH1 protein had a sexually dimorphic impact on survival. Fth1 heterozygosity significantly worsened survival in females but did not affect survival in male GBMs. Furthermore, the genetic manipulation of Fth1 significantly affected tumor infiltration of T-cells, CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cells, fibroblasts, and mast cells in a sexually dimorphic manner. These results demonstrate a role for FTH1 and presumably iron status in establishing the tumor cellular landscape that ultimately impacts survival and further reveals a sex bias that may inform the population studies showing a sex effect on the prevalence of brain tumors.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40121844', 'title': 'Immune prognostic model for glioblastoma based on the ssGSEA enrichment score.', 'abstract': 'Few effective immune prognostic models based on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for glioblastoma have been reported.

This longitudinal cohort study with a substantial sample size (n\\u2009=\\u20092825) included patients with non-recurrent glioma who were pathologically diagnosed and had undergone initial surgical resection between 2010 and 2018. Logistic regression models and stratified Cox proportional hazards models were established with the top 15 clinical variables significantly influencing outcomes screened by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. Preoperative and postoperative models predicting short-term (within 6 months) postoperative recurrence in glioma patients were developed to explore the risk factors associated with short- and long-term recurrence in glioma patients. Preoperative and postoperative logistic models predicting short-term recurrence had accuracies of 0.78 and 0.87, respectively. A range of biological and early symptomatic characteristics linked to short- and long-term recurrence have been pinpointed.

This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 3,445 individuals with PD completed the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-S), the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part 2 (UPDRS-2), and the Non-Motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQ). Participants were categorized into four groups based on GDS-S scores: normal (0-4), mild (5-8), moderate (9-11), and severe (≥12). Kruskal-Wallis tests, Pearson correlations, and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to assess associations between depression severity, PA, and PD symptoms. Higher depression severity was associated with worse motor (UPDRS-2, χ² = 756.72, p < .001) and non-motor (NMSQ, χ² = 1072.13, p < .001) symptoms and lower PA levels (PASE, χ² = 396.24, p < .001). Regression analysis showed that NMSQ (β = 0.449, p < .001), UPDRS-2 (β = 0.212, p < .001), and PASE (β = -0.171, p < .001) significantly predicted depression severity. Depression severity in PD is strongly linked to increased PD symptom. These findings highlight the importance of integrating physical activity interventions and mental health strategies into PD management to improve overall well-being.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40304760', 'title': 'Acute kidney injury with cast nephropathy following creatine loading in a 17-year-old.', 'abstract': 'This case highlights a 17-year-old male who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with cast nephropathy following a 6-day high-dose creatine loading regimen.

Suppression of GnRH/LH pulses in lactating dams is assumed to be caused by suckling stimuli and a chronic negative energy balance due to milk production. The present study aimed to investigate whether the central enkephalin-δ opioid receptor (DOR) signaling mediated the suppression of LH secretion by acute suckling stimuli and/or chronic negative energy balance due to milk production in rats during late lactation when dams were under a heavy energy demand. On postpartum day 16, the number of Penk (enkephalin mRNA)-expressing cells in the arcuate nucleus was significantly higher in lactating rats than in non-lactating control rats. Pulsatile LH secretion was suppressed in rats with chronic suckling or acute 1-h suckling stimuli 6 h after pup removal on day 16 of lactation. Central DOR antagonism significantly increased the mean LH concentrations and the baseline of LH pulses in rats with chronic suckling but not with acute suckling stimuli on day 16 of lactation. Besides, central κ opioid receptor (KOR) antagonism increased the amplitude of LH pulses in rats with the acute suckling stimuli on day 16 of lactation. These results suggest that central DOR signaling mediates the suppression of LH secretion caused by a negative energy balance in rats receiving chronic suckling during late lactation.

National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the severity of stroke clinically. Inflammatory biomarkers such as plasma MMP-9, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and S100B were measured using the ELISA kits. We observed that plasma concentration of MMP-9, IL-6, and S100B showed statistical significant association with severity of stroke as assessed by NIHSS, with Chi-square test values of χ2 = 24.69 for IL-6 (P = 0.00), χ2 = 11.91 for S100B (P = 0.008), and χ2 = 19.5 for MMP-9 (P = 0.00).

This paper describes a feasible method to obtain accurate control of lung volume during chest imaging in pediatric patients with lung disease. A procedure to obtain maximal respiratory manoeuvres with spirometry guidance during image acquisition for CT and MRI is described. This procedure requires training of the subject, an MRI compatible spirometer and close collaboration between a lung function scientist and the radiographer. A good to excellent target volume level for the inspiratory or expiratory scan can be achieved in around 90% of children. An important condition for this success rate is the training of the subject, executed prior to each chest CT or MRI, and instructions by the lung function scientist during the chest CT. Implementing lung volume guidance with a spirometer is an important and feasible step to standardize chest imaging and to optimize the diagnostic yield of chest CT and MRI in children with lung disease. Training and the collaborative effort by a lung function scientist and radiographer is the key factor for success of this procedure.

This study aimed to explore family caregivers' experience of caring for patients undergoing hemodialysis at Muhimbili National Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A qualitative study employing phenomenological design was conducted. Fourteen family caregivers of patients receiving hemodialysis services at Muhimbili National Hospital were purposively selected. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were used for data collection. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed following Braun and Clarke's six phases of thematic analysis. The study uncovered four key themes from fourteen interviews. The themes were: 1) Family caregivers and providers' interaction, focusing on interpersonal and professional relationships 2) The status of dialysis treatment, describing access and availability of resources for the provision of hemodialysis services 3) Impact of long-term care, touching issues of emotional, physical and social-economic impact to family members and 4) Coping with caring, describing internal and external mechanisms family members use to adjust to demanding situation of caring their loved ones.

However, the management of heparins is complex and, in some cases, requires frequent laboratory measurements for monitoring. They can eventually cause severe adverse events, such as life-threatening bleeding episodes or thrombosis associated with immune activation of platelets. Understanding the characteristics of these anticoagulants, their use and correct monitoring will allow us to use the different heparins safely. The role of the haemostasis laboratory is essential to adjust the dose of unfractionated heparin, which have proven to be difficult to manage for the general practitioner. In this document we actualize the laboratory and clinical management of heparins and related drugs in the modern anticoagulation era.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40234608', 'title': 'HFD-induced LPS translocation and elevated blood lipids exacerbated the inflammatory response in allergic rhinitis.', 'abstract': 'Allergic rhinitis (AR) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, with studies indicating that a high-fat diet (HFD) may heighten susceptibility to AR. This study aims to investigate the impact of HFD on ovalbumin (OVA)-induced AR using both an OVA-sensitized rat model and a macrophage model treated with palmitic acid (PA). The systemic effects of HFD were explored with respect to intestinal barrier integrity, serum lipids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and inflammatory response. In AR rats fed with HFD, there was a reduction in the expression of tight junction proteins in colon tissues, increased serum levels of lipids and LPS, and elevated inflammatory responses in both nasal lavage fluid (NLF) and serum. Additionally, there was enhanced NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activity observed in both nasal and colon tissues. In vitro experiments demonstrated that PA and LPS synergistically amplified inflammatory responses in THP-1-derived macrophages, paralleling the systemic findings. These results suggest that HFD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction facilitates the translocation of LPS into the bloodstream. Elevated serum LPS level, together with increased blood lipids levels, may exacerbate the inflammatory response in AR through the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40346882', 'title': 'Environmental Change Can Result in Irreversible Biodiversity Loss in Recently Formed Species Flocks.', 'abstract': 'Adaptive radiations, where a lineage diversifies into multiple species exploiting different niches, are key drivers of biodiversity. It is therefore important to understand the factors that drive such radiations and how changing environmental conditions affect their persistence. Using a size-structured model, I study how changing environmental conditions impact the persistence of a six-species flock. At birth, individuals are constrained to feed on a shared resource. As they mature, individuals diversify into six specialized forms, each adapted to feed on specific resources. Environmental changes affecting one species can trigger a cascade, altering the size structure of the focal species and subsequently affecting resource availability for other species. Under these altered ecological conditions, coexistence of all species becomes impossible. Importantly, once species are lost, they cannot re-establish even when environmental conditions return to their original state, resulting in irreversible biodiversity loss. These findings underscore the vulnerability of species flocks to environmental change and highlight the potential for unexpected outcomes in the face of shifting ecological conditions due to climate change.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40369003', 'title': 'Development and validation of heat resistant rolling and deformation absorbing nozzle necks for friction and reaction force reduction.', 'abstract': \"Minimizing frictional forces due to jamming between critical components such as shutters and nozzle necks is essential for ensuring the reliability of solid-propellant thrusters.

Aims of this multicenter, retrospective study were to describe thoracic CT findings in a group of dogs with confirmed disease, determine whether any changes were consistent among dogs, and propose standardized terms for describing thoracic CT findings. Nine UK-based referral centers' clinical and imaging databases were searched for dogs that had a confirmed diagnosis of A. vasorum, and had undergone thoracic CT examination. Eighteen dogs, from seven of the centers, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The lung lobes were divided into the following three zones and the CT changes described in each: pleural (zone 1), subpleural (zone 2), and peribronchovascular (zone 3). The predominent abnormality was increased lung attenuation due to poorly defined ground-glass opacity or consolidation. There were regions of mosaic attenuation due to peripheral bronchiectasis. Nine/18 (50%) dogs showed hyperattenuating nodules of varying sizes with ill-defined margins. The distribution always affected zones 1 and 2 with varied involvement of zone 3; this resulted in clear delineation between zones 2 and 3. Tracheobronchial lymphadenomegaly was frequently noted. Findings were nonspecific and there was considerable overlap with other pulmonary conditions. However, authors recommend that A. vasorum be considered a likely differential diagnosis for dogs with a predominantly peripheral distribution of lung changes.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40375977', 'title': 'Studying the effects of McRoberts and neonate-focused maneuvers on the neonatal brachial plexus during shoulder dystocia.', 'abstract': 'This study investigates the effects of clinical delivery maneuvers on neonatal brachial plexus (BP) during complicated birthing scenarios such as shoulder dystocia. Shoulder dystocia occurs when the anterior shoulder of the neonate is obstructed behind the maternal symphysis pubis and prevents the delivery of the neonate. Maneuvers such as McRoberts, application of suprapubic pressure (SPP), oblique positioning, and posterior arm delivery are performed sequentially to alleviate the obstruction. This study used MADYMO, a computer software program, to simulate these maneuvers during shoulder dystocia while maternal endogenous forces (82N and 129N) were applied. The recorded outcomes were the magnitude of neonatal BP stretch during delivery and the amount of clinician-applied traction (CAT) force, if required, to achieve delivery. The lithotomy position was treated as the baseline and compared to the McRoberts position, at 82N and 129N maternal forces. Additionally, in McRoberts position, at 82N and 129N maternal forces, neonate-focused maneuvers were applied, and the clinician applied traction (CAT) force, if required, to achieve delivery was recorded along with the resulting neonatal BP stretch. The simulations, at 82N maternal force, reported a decrease in required CAT force in the McRoberts position compared to the lithotomy position. The results of the neonate-focused maneuvers reported a further decrease in the CAT force and the resulting BP stretch. Furthermore, increasing SPP from 40N to 100N reported no required CAT force for delivery along with decreased BP stretch. Oblique positioning further decreased the BP stretch, and the posterior arm delivery of the neonate resulted in the least amount of BP stretch. No CAT forces were required during these maneuvers. The simulations, at 129N maternal force, reported similar trends of reduced BP stretch during delivery except no CAT forces were required during any simulated conditions. Findings from this study help understand the effects of McRoberts position and neonate-focused maneuvers on neonatal brachial plexus during complicated shoulder dystocia delivery. The reported required delivery forces, both maternal and CAT also lay the groundwork for clinician training and education while guiding the development of preventative approaches that can limit neonatal injuries.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430329', 'title': 'Lung or liver: An imaging dilemma on Tc-99m macroaggregated albumin lung perfusion scintigraphy.', 'abstract': 'We present a 10-year-old boy having the bronchiectasis who was subjected to lung perfusion scintigraphy before lung resection surgery to assess the lung parenchymal function.

While the facility was built to study tuberculosis transmission, this was its first adaptation to study H2A virus transmission.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study among outpatients enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System who had a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test or COVID-19 diagnosis and were eligible for NMV/r treatment between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2024. NMV/r-treated patients were compared with those who did not receive NMV/r and were considered unexposed until NMV/r was dispensed. We assessed the relationship between NMV/r receipt and being prescribed an outpatient antibiotic in the 30 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis using adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. We included 302,600 NMV/r-eligible outpatients with COVID-19, of whom 67,649 received NMV/r and 234,951 did not receive NMV/r. NMV/r-treated patients were less likely to receive outpatient antibiotics compared to those who did not receive NMV/r (7.2% [4,901/67,649] vs 9.2% [21,533/234,951], respectively; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, 95% CI: 0.63‒0.68). After excluding patients who received an antibiotic prescription upon COVID-19 diagnosis (i.e., likely empiric therapy), this relationship was attenuated (HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87‒0.95). NMV/r-eligible patients with COVID-19 who received NMV/r were 35% less likely to be prescribed outpatient antibiotics compared to patients who did not receive NMV/r, possibly driven by a diminished perceived need for empiric antibiotic therapy. Treatment with NMV/r may reduce unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use. Antibiotics should be reserved for patients with a high suspicion of bacterial co-infection.IMPORTANCEAntimicrobial resistance, driven by the overuse of antibiotics, is a major global health threat. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated this issue, with antibiotics often prescribed to patients with COVID-19 despite being ineffective against viruses. These practices, typically aimed at preventing or empirically treating rare bacterial co-infections, have raised concerns about accelerating resistance. The antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (NMV/r), widely used in high-risk patients with COVID-19 to prevent severe illness, offers an opportunity to reassess antibiotic use in patients with respiratory infections. Our study of over 300,000 patients in a national healthcare system found that those treated with NMV/r for COVID-19 were 35% less likely to receive antibiotics than those who did not receive the antiviral. Lower antibiotic use among patients treated with NMV/r may reflect a reduction in unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use. These findings highlight the potential role of antivirals in supporting antibiotic stewardship and addressing a critical public health challenge.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40330719', 'title': 'Benign Cystic Mesothelioma of the Peritoneum Arising at the Greater Omentum in a 14-Year-Old Boy.', 'abstract': 'Mesothelioma arises from mesothelial cells.

This study explores the relationship of early-life stress and FMS by examining its mediation through perceived stress, and acute and chronic endocrine stress indicators. Stress was assessed using the perceived stress scale, as well as using salivary and hair cortisol as endocrine indicators of acute and chronic stress, respectively. The sample consisted of 99 individuals with FMS and 50 pain-free controls. A structural equation model was used to assess the mediating effects of stress indicators between early adversities and the severity of FMS. Compared with controls, individuals with FMS had notably higher early adversity scores (d = 0.63) and greater occurrence of exposure to adversity (78.8% vs 66%). Structural equation modeling indicated that the influence of early adversities on FMS symptoms is mediated by perceived stress levels, with no direct effect observed. Our findings indicate that early-life adversity is a significant determinant of the development of FMS, with the relationship between these factors mediated by perceived stress rather than by endocrine stress indicators.

Bronchiectasis has multiple etiologies, but is usually considered in terms of whether it is due to the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (CF) or secondary to other causes (non-CF bronchiectasis, NCFB). Inhaled antibiotics are used in bronchiectasis to suppress bacterial pathogens and reduce long-term lung function decline. The majority of the literature on inhaled antibiotics comes from studies on CF where the dominant bacterial pathogen in the airway is usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, most aerosolized antibiotic regimens target this bacterium, but the emergence of molecular diagnostic methods has questioned this approach and more tailored strategies may need to be considered in CF based on the community composition of the lung microbiome. Similarly, the lung microbiome in NCFB has been found to be a complex polymicrobial one and the current practice of employing the same inhaled antibiotic regimes as are used in CF may no longer be appropriate in many patients.

A detailed clinical history may point toward a specific diagnosis. Pertinent clinical questions include history of smoking, collagen vascular disease, inhalation injury, medication use and organ transplantation. It is important also to evaluate possible systemic and pulmonary signs of infection, evidence of air trapping, and high-pitched expiratory wheezing, which may suggest small airways involvement. Pulmonary function tests and plain chest radiography may demonstrate abnormalities; however, they rarely prove sufficiently specific to obviate bronchoscopic or surgical biopsy. High-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning of the chest is often an important diagnostic tool to guide diagnosis in these difficult cases, because different subtypes of bronchiolar disorders may present with characteristic image findings. Some histopathologic patterns of bronchiolar disease may be relatively unique to a specific clinical context but others are nonspecific with respect to either etiology or pathogenesis. Primary bronchiolar disorders include acute bronchiolitis, respiratory bronchiolitis, follicular bronchiolitis, mineral dust airway disease, constrictive bronchiolitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis, and other rare variants. Prominent bronchiolar involvement may be seen in several interstitial lung diseases, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, collagen vascular disease, respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, and pulmonary Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. Large airway diseases that commonly involve bronchioles include bronchiectasis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

It has a prevalence in the United States of 5.1% to 5.4% in the middle-aged to elderly population, with a lower rate in nonsmoking individuals. Moreover, COPD is complicated by frequent and recurring acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB). Overall, COPD represents the fourth leading cause of mortality in the United States and is the second leading cause of work disability. This condition is also associated with high morbidity and health care expenditures. Despite the controversy over the need to prescribe antibiotics for patients with AECB, high-risk patients have been identified who will benefit from this therapy.These include, patients with a history of repeated infections (>4 per year), comorbid illnesses (such as diabetes, asthma, coronary heart disease), or marked airway obstruction. Furthermore, a bacterial cause is shown in approximately 50% of AECB episodes, and primarily includes Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Additionally, resistance among community-acquired respiratory pathogens in the United States has risen dramatically, with beta-lactamase production evident in 40% of H. influenzae and greater than 95% of M. catarrhalis isolates, and with approximately 10% of pneumococci highly resistant to penicillin and simultaneously resistant to macrolide antibiotics. The criteria used to make choices for antibiotic use in patients with AECB should include knowledge of the frequencies of pathogen resistance and patients' clinical characteristics. An effective antibiotic, however, must be able to rapidly resolve the acute infection with the least patient morbidity and need for hospitalization. Although there remains controversy as to when to initiate antibiotic therapy in patients with AECB, several guidelines have been published.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40363233', 'title': 'Internet of Medical Things Systems Review: Insights into Non-Functional Factors.', 'abstract': 'Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a rapidly evolving field with the potential to bring significant changes to healthcare.

A literature search of English-language studies in the PubMed database with no date restrictions was last conducted in May 2024. The combined searches yielded 612 citations, 31 of which were selected for full-text review and for inclusion in this assessment. The panel methodologist assigned a level of evidence rating to each study. Six were assigned a level I rating, 23 were assigned a level II rating, and 2 were assigned a level III rating. Studies were categorized based on treatment modalities: laser-based therapy, intravitreal therapy, laser-based therapy versus intravitreal therapy, and systemic therapies. Within those categories, they were separated based on treatments for acute versus chronic CSCR. One level I study showed that photodynamic therapy (PDT) using half-dose verteporfin for acute CSCR led to a significant decrease in subretinal fluid (SRF) with 95% of treated patients having no SRF at 12 months compared with 58% of untreated eyes with acute CSCR (P\\xa0= 0.001). Anatomically, the mean CFT at 1 year was significantly lower in the treated group (161 ± 65 μm) versus the observation group (278 ± 92 μm) (P\\xa0= 0.001). A second level I study compared half-dose verteporfin PDT versus 30%-dose verteporfin PDT and found that 94.6% in the half-dose PDT group had no SRF at 12 months compared with 75.4% in the 30%-dose PDT group (P\\xa0= 0.004). The noninferiority of the 30%-dose PDT compared with half-dose PDT was not demonstrated. The VICI trial was a level I study that found no benefit with the use of mineralocorticoid antagonism with eplerenone for the treatment of chronic CSCR. With respect to the primary outcome of visual acuity (VA), the VICI trial found no significant difference at 12 months: 79.5 letters in the placebo group and 80.4 letters in the eplerenone group (P\\xa0= 0.24). In general, the results from the other evaluated studies were inconsistent and thus inconclusive. There were no level I studies that supported the role of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections or systemic beta-blockers for patients with CSCR. A small level I study showed potential efficacy of Helicobacter pylori therapy for CSCR. There is evidence to support half-dose PDT for the treatment of acute CSCR regarding anatomic improvement, but less robust evidence supports improvement in VA or sustained anatomic benefit beyond 12 months. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and oral beta-blockers demonstrate inconsistent anatomic and visual benefits in patients with CSCR. The mineralocorticoid antagonist eplerenone has not been demonstrated as efficacious for treatment of chronic CSCR.

Here, our findings indicate that immune exhaustion markers are highly expressed on peripheral αβ and γδ T cells in NPC patients. Serum RA levels are negatively correlated with the abundance of Tim-3 on circulating Vδ2 T cells. Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that RA/RAR signaling directly targets Vδ2 T cells, repressing Tim-3 expression, promoting NF-κB activation, and enhancing the production of antitumor-related cytokines. Notably, RA supplementation improved the efficacy of Vδ2 T cell-mediated immunotherapy in human NPC by suppressing Tim-3 expression.

Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms involved in the development and persistence of pain in OSP have not yet been fully elucidated, although immune cells are known to play a key role in these processes. Indeed, they release several molecules that promote persistent inflammation and nociceptive stimulation, resulting in the gating of ion channels responsible for the generation and propagation of the noxious stimulus. The adoption of countermeasures to counteract the OSP progression and reduce the algic component appears to be necessary, providing patients with a better quality of life and greater adherence to treatment. In addition, the development of multimodal therapies, based on an interdisciplinary approach, appears to be crucial, combining the use of anti-osteoporotic drugs with an educational programme, regular physical activity, and proper nutrition to eliminate risk factors.

As an absorbable and degradable metallic material, magnesium alloys undergo gradual degradation, wear, and fracture within the body. These alloys reduce the long-term risks associated with permanent implants but generate insoluble byproducts that accumulate in surrounding tissues. Following the implantation of magnesium alloys, granulation tissue and fibrous encapsulation typically form around the material. However, limited research has addressed the interaction between insoluble byproducts of magnesium alloys and macrophages. This study focused on the biological effects of macrophages during the second stage of the host inflammatory response in the degradation process of magnesium alloy. Using subcutaneous implantation of WE43 magnesium alloy sheets, observations were made regarding the degradation components, morphological changes in surrounding tissues, and the biological effects of macrophages upon phagocytosis of insoluble byproducts. The primary degradation products of WE43 in vivo were identified as Ca'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39574470', 'title': 'Caffeic acid hinders the proliferation and migration through inhibition of IL-6 mediated JAK-STAT-3 signaling axis in human prostate cancer.', 'abstract': 'Caffeic acid (CA) is considered a promising phytochemical that has inhibited numerous cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, it is gaining increasing attention due to its safe and pharmacological applications. In this study, we investigated the role of CA in inhibiting the Interleukin-6 (IL-6)/Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) mediated suppression of the proliferation signaling in human prostate cancer cells. The role of CA in proliferation and colony formation abilities was studied using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and colony formation assays. Tumour cell death and cell cycle arrest were identified using flow cytometry techniques. CA treatment-associated protein expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) families, IL-6/JAK/STAT-3, proliferation, and apoptosis protein expressions in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines were measured using Western blot investigation. We have obtained that treatment with CA inhibits prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and LNCaP) proliferation and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, CA treatment alleviates the expression phosphorylated form of MAPK families, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 in PC-3 cells. IL-6 mediated JAK/STAT3 expressions regulate the proliferation and antiapoptosis that leads to prostate cancer metastasis and migration. Therefore, to mitigate the expression of IL-6/JAK/STAT-3 is considered an important target for the treatment of prostate cancer. In this study, we have observed that CA inhibits the expression of IL-6, JAK1, and phosphorylated STAT-3 in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Due to the inhibitory effect of IL-6/JAK/STAT-3, it resulted in decreased expression of cyclin-D1, cyclin-D2, and CDK1 in both PC-3 cells. In addition, CA induces apoptosis by enhancing the expression of Bax and caspase-3; and decreased expression of Bcl-2 in prostate cancer cells. Thus, CA might act as a therapeutical application against prostate cancer by targeting the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling axis.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39961406', 'title': 'Local immune response induced by intra-fin antigen injection in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is a useful model for immunological studies.', 'abstract': 'Teleost fishes play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of immune system evolution because they retain the ancient characteristics of vertebrate immunity, encompassing both innate and adaptive immune systems. Among these, innate immunity plays a critical role in fish as the first line of defense, coordinating rapid responses to pathogen infections. However, the lack of fish-specific immunological methodologies has limited progress in elucidating fish immune mechanisms. To better understand how the innate immune response develops and resolves in fish, detailed observation and integrative analysis of leukocytes at multiple time points is necessary. In the present study, an intra-fin injection method for observing local immune responses in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) was tested and optimized to analyze the progression of zymosan-induced innate immune responses. Zymosan-injected medaka showed a rapid immune response characterized by leukocyte recruitment and phagocytosis. Using TG(FmpxP:mCherry) transgenic medaka with mCherry fluorescence driven by myeloperoxidase (mpx) promoter, granulocyte chemotaxis towards the site of zymosan entry was successfully visualized. The rapid increase in tumor necrosis factor α (tnfa), interleukin-1β (il1b), interleukin-6 (il6), and CXC motif chemokine ligand 8 (cxcl8) expressions in zymosan-injected anal fins provided a molecular basis for the visualized tissue-specific cellular response.

This study aimed to explore the effects of adolescent health behaviors on adult depressed mood using the adolescent pathway model (APM). Our sample consisted of n\\u2009=\\u20091109 Norwegians [45.5% female], who were surveyed from ages 13 to 40 across ten time points. Using linear regression analyses, we examined (1) the association between parental SES [household income and parental education] and adolescent health behaviors [breakfast regularity, leisure time physical activity (LTPA), difficulties falling asleep, alcohol consumption, and smoking], and (2) the associations between adolescent health behaviors and adult depressed mood, and whether these were moderated by indicators of parental SES. We also assessed how health behaviors are associated with social inequality in adult depressed mood. In this context, social inequality was defined as the covariance between adult SES (i.e., income and education) and adult depressed mood. Higher household income predicted higher levels of LTPA, and higher parental education predicted greater breakfast regularity. None of the health behaviors were associated with adult depressed mood, nor did they show moderation by SES. Adolescent health behaviors did not independently account for social inequality in adult depressed mood. The study suggests minimal socioeconomic differences in adolescent health behaviors, which do not significantly account for social inequalities in adult depressed mood. This offers limited support for the behavioral explanation of health inequalities within the framework of the APM. However, adolescent depressed mood emerges as the strongest predictor of adult depressed mood, highlighting its importance as a key focus for early intervention efforts.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39635213', 'title': 'Correlation between the physical activity volume and cognitive and mental capacity among older adult people in China: a cross-sectional study based on the 2020 CHARLS database.', 'abstract': \"Currently, due to the progress of the aging population in China and the government's attention to healthy aging, there is an increasing emphasis on the cognitive function and psychological function of older adult people.

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) was used to assess mental capacity, and cognitive function was evaluated across three domains: orientation, memory and calculation. Total physical activity data were obtained via interviews. Ability of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Ability of Daily Living (IADL) scores were used to determine the presence or absence of daily physical function impairment. Finally, we conducted correlation analysis and logistic regression on participants' physical activity volume (PAV) and their cognitive and psychological functions, respectively. A total of 5,871 participants who met the inclusion criteria were selected from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The prevalence of depression was 8.1, and 31.6% of the older adult participants reported experienced depressive symptoms. Additionally, 15.6% of the older adult individuals had insufficient weekly physical activity, while 3.9% had daily physical function (DPF) impairment. Physical activity volume (PAV) was negatively correlated with the CESD-10 score, as well as with orientation, calculation, and memory.

This study evaluates health-related quality of life and the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with chronic hepatitis C before, during, and following IFN-alpha therapy. Patients undergoing IFN-alpha therapy for chronic hepatitis C were asked to complete health status measures as well as anxiety and depression inventories before, during, and following IFN-alpha therapy. These measures were compared to the results of healthy adults in the general US population. Thirty-eight of forty-eight eligible patients (79%) with chronic hepatitis C completed the questionnaires. Respondents demonstrated a significant increase in depression during the sixth month of interferon therapy in comparison to pretreatment results. Anxiety scores improved significantly after one month of IFN-alpha in comparison to pretreatment results. Scores on the health status measures did not vary with IFN-alpha therapy. Patient responses were analyzed with respect to biochemical response (normalized transaminases) to IFN-alpha. IFN-alpha responders, who were aware of their transaminase results, exhibited lower scores on anxiety subscales during and after therapy (P = 0.02-0.04). Scores on the health status subscale, role emotional, improved in IFN-alpha responders compared to nonresponders during the sixth month of therapy (P = 0.02). Response to IFN-alpha therapy was not associated with any other differences on subscale analysis. Patients with chronic hepatitis C exhibited health perceptions similar to the general US population, and these were unchanged during IFN-alpha therapy. However, the incidence of depression significantly increased during the sixth month of IFN-alpha therapy.

Among these, low molecular weight sodium alginate (SA-L) hydrogel exhibited notable stretching-induced anisotropy and structural stability during dehydration. Furthermore, increasing the controlled strains (CSN) could improve anisotropy, stretching strength, and Young's modulus which reached up to 100\\xa0MPa in anisotropic SA-L hydrogel. The anisotropic hydrogels closely mimicked the microstructure of whole-muscle foods.

Prediction models limited to psychiatric phenomenology have insufficient predictive power. Herein, we aimed to evaluate whether the presence of overweight/obesity is associated with greater cognitive decline in individuals at high risk (HR) or ultra high risk (UHR) for BD. We conducted a retrospective analysis to investigate the moderational role of body mass index (BMI) on measures of cognitive function. Subjects between the ages of 8 and 28 years with a positive family history of BD were compared to age-matched controls with a negative family history of BD. Subjects with at least one biological parent with bipolar I/II disorder were further stratified into UHR or HR status by the presence or absence, respectively, of subthreshold hypomanic, major depressive, attenuated psychotic, and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. A total of 36 individuals at HR for BD, 33 individuals at UHR for BD, and 48 age-matched controls were included in the analysis. Higher BMI was significantly associated with lower performance on measures of processing speed (i.e. Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia-symbol coding: r=-.186, P=.047) and attention/vigilance (i.e. Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs: r=-.257, P=.006).

It has been postulated that EGF in human milk may play an important role in the normal intestinal maturation since specific EGF receptors are present on the surface of intestinal cells. For this reason, human milk samples from mothers delivering prematurely, as well as at term gestation, were analyzed for their content of EGF. Samples from mothers delivering prematurely showed levels of 70 +/- 5 ng ml-1 and those delivering at term had levels of 68 +/- 19 ng ml-1. There was no diurnal variation and no change with length of lactation up to 50 days. Although previous studies demonstrated that subcutaneous injections of EGF given to suckling rats caused changes in morphology and enzyme activities, no studies had demonstrated that EGF caused changes in function. We injected two-week-old suckling rats and three-week-old weanling rats with 0.1 microgram of g-1 BW twice daily for three days. EGF treatment caused a decrease in somatic weight gain, an increase in weight per unit length of bowel, an increase in lactose specific activity and an increase in net calcium transport. In contrast to the two-week-old suckling rats, the EGF had no effect on intestinal function although somatic weight gain was also depressed in three-week-old animals.

Yet, adequate (noninvasive) quality metrics of engineered tissues are lacking. Moreover, insufficient insight into the role of donor variability and biological sex as influencing factors for the mechanism toward bone repair hinders the implementation of such protocols for personalized bone implants. Here, male and female bone-forming organoids were compared to non-bone-forming organoids regarding their extracellular matrix composition, transcriptome, and secreted proteome signatures to directly link in vivo outcomes to quality metrics. As a result, donor variability in bone-forming callus organoids pointed towards two distinct pathways to bone, through either a hypertrophic cartilage or a fibrocartilaginous template. The followed pathway was determined early, as a biological sex-dependent activation of distinct progenitor populations. Independent of donor or biological sex, a cartilage-to-bone transition was driven by a common panel of secreted factors that played a role in extracellular matrix remodeling, mineralization, and attraction of vasculature.

High frequency echocardiography was performed to evaluate cardiac function indices in adult zebrafish. 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) was used to pharmacologically inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stress in zebrafish. Western blot was carried out to determine expression of DNAJB6 isoforms in human patients' heart tissues. Global loss-of-function mutations affecting both the sarcomere-localized short (Dnajb6b[S]) and nucleus-localized long (Dnajb6b[L]) isoforms appeared phenotypically normal. In contrast, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a truncated, sarcomere-localized Dnajb6b(L) isoform (Dnajb6b[∆L]) led to severe cardiomyopathy and heart failure phenotypes. Mechanistically, Dnajb6b responded to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) stress and activation of Dnajb6b(∆L) resulted in elevated SR stress, accumulation of ubiquitinated protein aggregation, and aberrant activation of autophagy. 4-PBA treatment partially rescued cardiac dysfunction and extended the lifespan of zebrafish with cardiomyocyte-specific activation of Dnajb6b(∆L). Finally, elevated expression of both DNAJB6(S) and DNAJB6(L) isoforms was detected in failing human hearts, supporting their clinical relevance.

Significant increases in IL-23 levels were observed from remission (46.6\\xa0±\\xa04.3\\xa0pg/mL) to severe stages (218.5\\xa0±\\xa062.41\\xa0pg/mL), while VD levels did not show a similar trend. IL-23 levels also rose significantly with disease extent, from proctitis to pancolitis. A significant negative correlation was found between VD and IL-23 levels (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.3175; P\\xa0=\\xa00.035). IL-23 and pulse rate were significant predictors of UC in our cohort. Our findings highlight VD insufficiency to be prevalent in UC patients, with VD levels negatively correlating with IL-23 levels, which increase with disease severity and extent. Further, understanding the interplay between VD and IL-23 will help design therapeutic interventions to modulate immune response and disease progression.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40329723', 'title': 'Milk Thistle (Silybum marianum): Potential Role in Cancer Prevention.', 'abstract': \"Milk thistle compounds have recently gained attention for their potential role in cancer prevention and treatment. Despite most evidence reporting this property refers to in vitro and animal studies, Milk thistle flavonoids may provide insightful suggestions about novel chemopreventive agents. This narrative review provides an overview of the current understanding of milk thistle's effects on cancer cells and highlights possible mechanisms of action. The active compounds in milk thistle mainly exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which protect cells and enhance their survival responses, even inhibiting cancer development. In addition, the compounds possess immunomodulatory properties crucial in preventing cancer progression. Another important mechanism is the induction of apoptosis, promoting cancer cell death and inhibiting tumour growth. These compounds inhibit angiogenesis, preventing tumour growth and spread. Due to their potential to inhibit cancer progression, they modulate cell signalling pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, which are involved in cell growth and survival. Although current research is promising, it is crucial to address the current gaps in knowledge about milk thistle compounds in cancer prevention and treatment. Future studies should focus on rigorous clinical trials, dose optimization, mechanistic investigations, combination therapy approaches, and personalized medicine to maximize their potential. Basic experimental evidence can provide new clues to establish clinical trials to improve cancer care and reassure patients and healthcare professionals.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39495037', 'title': 'Evidence-Base Update of Psychosocial and Combination Treatments for Child and Adolescent Depression.', 'abstract': 'This evidence-based update (EBU) builds on three previous reviews (1998, 2008, 2017) sponsored by the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology with the aim of evaluating the empirical support for psychosocial interventions for depression in youth.

Descriptive effect sizes and number-needed-to-treat (NNT) ratios were calculated for primary outcomes. Results were integrated with prior reviews, and cumulative evidence used to classify treatments as well-established, probably efficacious, possibly efficacious, or experimental. Published secondary analyses of predictors, moderators, and mediators were examined. For adolescents, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT-A), CBT in combination with antidepressant medication, and collaborative care programs were all classified as well-established. The evidence was considerably weaker for children, with no treatments achieving well-established or probably efficacious status. New developments include greater exploration of parent- and family-mediated treatment models and increasing evidence on technology-assisted interventions. Data on predictors, moderators, and mediators continued to be focused on adolescent depression samples and drawn from a limited number of RCT datasets. Since the prior EBU, there has been incremental progress in youth depression treatment research. There is an urgent need to: (a) develop innovative approaches to substantially improve on the modest effects seen in most RCTs, (b) expand the evidence base for children and other underserved groups, (c) craft evidence-based guidelines for choosing between interventions when multiple efficacious treatments do exist, and (d) address issues of treatment effectiveness and scalability to ameliorate the wide prevalence and high impact of depression in youth.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40056788', 'title': 'Updates and controversies in the management of uterine serous carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma.', 'abstract': 'Uterine serous carcinoma and uterine carcinosarcoma are among the rarest but most lethal endometrial cancer sub-types, accounting for 15% of all cases, and are responsible for more than 50% of related deaths.

Lately, 'affective touch' (AT) has been shown to have pain relieving properties but only one study has investigated its effects on TSSP and the neural underpinnings of such interaction are unknown. In the present EEG study, thirty-six healthy participants went through three conditions where a TSSP protocol was applied in concomitance with no touch (NoT), discriminative touch (DT) and AT. A fourth no-pain no-touch condition acted as a baseline. Measures of attention during the four conditions and of pleasantness during the touch conditions were also recorded. Pain ratings were significantly lower only during the AT condition. The neural response during NoT, compared to the baseline, brought about a temporal decrease in power at delta and theta frequencies and a fronto-central increase mainly in the alpha rhythm. Adding AT to TSSP yielded, compared to NoT, a decrease in delta, theta and beta bands in midline regions at both central (Cz) and parietal (Pz) and also of gamma at Pz. Notably, DT was not associated with significant changes compared to pain alone (NoT), but a specific marked difference was found between AT and DT with the former showing a significant decrease in beta frequencies localized at Pz. While TSSP seems to be characterized by a modulation mostly of the lower frequencies, adding AT to TSSP brings a clear depression of all the major frequency bands. Additionally, the parietal beta reduction may be a biomarker of AT. Future studies can examine if such brain response can help finding a suitable intervention for TSSP-related chronic pain conditions. PERSPECTIVE: This study consolidates the idea that AT can lower pain in a TSSP paradigm and shows what are the brain (EEG) responses associated with both TSSP and TSSP modulation by AT. Given that TSSP is linked to central sensitization and that it can be used as an experimental model for chronic pain, our results pave the way for further studies into the neural mechanisms of AT-led analgesia, which can lead to future effective treatments.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40355365', 'title': 'Late gestational nutrient restriction decreases placental size and calf birth weight without altering uterine blood flow in primiparous beef females.', 'abstract': \"To investigate impacts of late gestational nutrient restriction in first-parity beef females on prenatal nutrient availability to calves, fall-calving heifers [body weight (BW): 472 ± 33 (SD) kg; body condition score (BCS): 5.4 ± 0.5] were individually-fed 100% (control; CON; n = 13) or 70% (nutrient restricted; NR; n = 13) of metabolizable energy and metabolizable protein requirements for maintenance, pregnancy, and growth from day 160 of gestation to calving.

We included T2DM patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve replacement between 2015 and 2018. PSM was used to balance covariates between metformin users and non-users. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to assess POD risk and its cumulative incidence. Metformin use was associated with a significantly reduced risk of POD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.67). A dose-response trend was observed, with decreasing aORs for higher cumulative metformin exposure. Protective factors included higher income, urban residency, and statin use; risk factors included older age, prolonged anesthesia, higher aDCSI, CCI scores, and depression. Metformin significantly lowers the risk of POD in T2DM patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery, showing a clear dose-dependent protective effect. These findings highlight metformin's potential as a chemopreventive agent against post-surgical complications in this population.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40245734', 'title': 'Environmental impact assessment of tannin-based coagulants production from chestnut shells.', 'abstract': 'The increasing demand for freshwater faces challenges and assessing the environmental sustainability of wastewater treatment is crucial.

This study investigates the critical issue of predicting 72-hour fatality in patients with severe hyperphosphatemia (≥ 10 mg/dL). We analyzed data from 530 patients treated at the Saitama Medical Center, Japan, from 2004 to 2019, including 153 72-hour fatalities. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (MLRA), Prediction One™ (Sony Network Communications Inc., Tokyo, Japan, https://predictionone.sony.biz/), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) were used to predict fatalities. These methods were evaluated on a validation set of 331 patients from 2020 to 2023, including 104 fatalities. Calibration plots for training and validation data were used for comparison. The fatality rate was 28.9% in the training data and 31.4% in the validation data. MLRA identified five fatality factors: age, low albumin, high aspartate aminotransferase, and elevated potassium and magnesium levels, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.801, 0.890), sensitivity of 0.862, and specificity of 0.704. Prediction One™ achieved an AUC of 0.770 (95% CI: 0.722, 0.818), sensitivity of 0.654, and specificity of 0.769. LightGBM achieved an AUC of 0.948 (95% CI: 0.923, 0.973), sensitivity of 0.863, and specificity of 0.889. The validation calibration plot showed that MLRA had the closest regression coefficient to 1.0 at 0.903. Although MLRA was the most accurate in predicting 72-hour fatalities, machine learning methods provided valuable insights into the importance of variables.

A total of six randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and 13 open-label trials involving the use of gabapentin and pregabalin in BD patients were reviewed. Overall, the studies show that gabapentin and its related drug pregabalin do not have significant clinical efficacy as either monotherapy or adjunctive therapy for BD. Gabapentin and pregabalin are probably ineffective for acute mania based on the findings of RCT, with only small open-label trials to support its potential adjunctive role.

SD is known to alter brain gene expression in rodents, but it remains unclear which changes are linked to sleep homeostasis. To investigate this question, we analyzed RNA-seq data from adult male mice subjected to 3 and 5-6 hours of SD and 2 and 6 hours of subsequent RS. We hypothesized molecular changes associated with sleep homeostasis mirror sleep pressure dynamics as defined by brain electrical activity, peaking at 5-6 hours of SD and no longer differentially expressed after 2 hours of RS. We report 5-6 hours of SD produces the largest effect on gene expression and the majority of DEGs normalize after 2 hours of RS. These genes are involved in cellular redox homeostasis, DNA damage/repair and chromatin regulation, and may underlie the molecular basis of sleep homeostasis. Genes associated with cellular stress do not normalize within 6 hours of RS and may underlie non-sleep specific effects of SD. Additionally, RS affects gene expression related to energy metabolism and Wnt-signaling, potentially contributing to its restorative effects.

The moderate to advanced PD patients treated with LCE had more significant improvement in MMSE scores (P\\u2009=\\u20090.004) and MoCA scores (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), as well as a greater decline in IL-6 levels (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002) than those treated with LC. There were no significant differences in the changes of the UPDRS III, PDQ39, HAMA, and HAMD scores between the two treatment groups. Linear correlation analysis revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between the improvement of MoCA scores (ΔMoCA) and the reduction of IL-6 levels (ΔIL-6) (correlation coefficient: -0.252; P\\u2009=\\u20090.024). The ability of LCE to improve cognitive function and to downregulate the peripheral inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels in moderate to advanced PD is superior to the traditional dopamine preparation-LC.

More SDs arise over hours in adjacent tissue, expanding the neuronal damage. This period represents a therapeutic window to inhibit SD and so reduce impending tissue injury. Yet most neuroscientists assume that the course of early brain injury can be explained by glutamate excitotoxicity, the concept that immediate glutamate release promotes early and downstream brain injury. There are many problems with glutamate release being the unseen culprit, the most practical being that the concept has yielded zero therapeutics over the past 30\\xa0years. But the basic science is also flawed, arising from dubious foundational observations beginning in the 1950s METHODS: Literature pertaining to excitotoxicity and to SD over the past 60 years is critiqued. Excitotoxicity theory centers on the immediate and excessive release of glutamate with resulting neuronal hyperexcitation. This instigates poststroke cascades with subsequent secondary neuronal injury. By contrast, SD theory argues that although SD evokes some brief glutamate release, acute neuronal damage and the subsequent cascade of injury to neurons are elicited by the metabolic stress of SD, not by excessive glutamate release. The challenge we present here is to find new clinical targets based on more informed basic science. This is motivated by the continuing failure by neuroscientists and by industry to develop drugs that can reduce brain injury following ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, or sudden cardiac arrest. One important step is to recognize that SD plays a central role in promoting early neuronal damage. We argue that uncovering the molecular biology of SD initiation and propagation is essential because ischemic neurons are usually not acutely injured unless SD propagates through them. The role of glutamate excitotoxicity theory and how it has shaped SD research is then addressed, followed by a critique of its fading relevance to the study of brain injury. Spreading depolarizations better account for\\xa0the acute neuronal injury arising from brain\\xa0ischemia than does the\\xa0early and excessive release of glutamate.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40129223', 'title': 'Sotorasib versus docetaxel for previously treated KRAS G12C-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer: a plain language summary.', 'abstract': ''}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40233306', 'title': \"The relationship between physical function and psychological symptoms in Parkinson's: Perceptions of People with Parkinson's and Carers.\", 'abstract': \"People with Parkinson's (PwP) can experience both physical and psychological symptoms, and understanding the perspectives of people affected is crucial for improved management, and clinical outcomes. This online survey aimed to gain a better understanding of the relationship between the subjectively experienced physical and psychological symptoms by PwP and their carers, while also considering the influence of personal roles and past symptom experiences. A UK-wide survey of 251 PwP and 62 carers was conducted. The survey focused on reported diagnosed and non-diagnosed psychological symptoms experienced, their onset, and the perceived impact of physical and psychological symptoms on one another. Responses were summarised using descriptive statistics. A substantial proportion of respondents reported at least one diagnosed psychological condition (38.5%) or undiagnosed psychological symptoms (44.6%) such as anxiety and depression. Half of respondents reported perceiving a bi-directional interaction between physical and psychological symptoms, with this perception most reported in people with prior experience of psychological symptoms. Our sample shows that while PwP and carers have similar views on the impact of psychological symptoms, carers perceive the impact of physical symptoms to be greater than PwP. PwP and carers appear to perceive an interaction between physical and psychological symptoms in Parkinson's, noting that psychological symptoms frequently precede Parkinson's diagnosis but are often under-recognised. Improved awareness of the potential link between physical and psychological symptoms in PwP may help to improve assessment, and onward referral processes to enhance care. Further research may assist in identifying potential disease subtypes and allow the prediction of changes in physical and psychological presentation.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40329077', 'title': 'An \"on-off-on\" photoelectrochemical aptasensor using CoO as a signal label for T-2 toxin detection.', 'abstract': 'T-2 toxin, a mycotoxin commonly found in food, is recognized as one of the most harmful contaminants.

In this study, we identified exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1 as a novel biomarker in BCa diagnosis and aimed to investigate the underlying biological function. Dual luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pulldown assays, and xenograft mouse model were used to verify the competitive endogenous RNA mechanism of lnc-TAF12-2:1. We found exosomal lnc-TAF12-2:1 up-regulated in urinary exosomes, tumor tissues of patients, and BCa cells. Down-regulation of lnc-TAF12-2:1 impaired BCa cell proliferation and migration, and promoted cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis. The opposite effects were also observed when lnc-TAF12-2:1 was overexpressed. lnc-TAF12-2:1 was transferred by intercellular exosomes to modulate malignant biological behavior.

Poor-quality sleep is associated with the onset of many diseases, including cardiovascular and mental health disorders. When using anesthesia, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the metabolic dysfunction and immunosuppression linked to sleep loss to ensure appropriate perioperative management. Commonly used agents like propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine affect consciousness, pain levels, and autonomic responses. Inhaled anesthetics (e.g., sevoflurane and isoflurane) and intravenous anesthetics (propofol) act on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and influence stages of sleep and circadian rhythms. Ketamine may uniquely preserve some aspects of restorative sleep, while most anesthetics affect rapid eye movement (REM) and slow wave sleep (SWS), altering cognitive and physical recovery. Modifying anesthetic regimes depending on the patient's sleep history and risk factors can maximize sleep health and postoperative patient outcomes. The physiological effects of anesthesia on the central nervous system persist beyond the perioperative period by influencing sleep quality, circadian regulation, and postoperative outcomes. Effective pain management is a significant component in addressing sleep quality. Opioids, while effective for pain relief, disrupt sleep architecture by reducing REM and SWS, increasing awakening frequency, and potentially causing respiratory depression. Multimodal pain therapy, including non-opioid analgesics, can reduce dependence, improve sleep quality, and lower adverse effects. Anesthetic agents can influence the body's internal clock, leading to mood changes, fatigue, and cognitive deficits. This review exploits the relationship between sleep and anesthesia, detailing the effect of anesthetic agents on the quality, architecture, and recovery of sleep patterns post-surgery. It also explores how these agents influence sleep stages, such as REM and non-REM sleep, and their implications for patient outcomes. Incorporating sleep optimization techniques can enhance recovery timelines and patient well-being. Researching anesthetic techniques that support postoperative sleep health is essential for further improving patient outcomes.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35393906', 'title': 'Translation and validation of the SCRAM questionnaire in a German adolescent inpatient sample.', 'abstract': 'Sleep, depressive symptoms and circadian preference are highly interconnected processes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the current evidence of enduring effects of psychotherapy, antidepressants and their combination after the end of treatment. PubMed and PsychINFO were systematically screened according to PRISMA guidelines (except for preregistration). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) between 1980 and 2022 comparing the efficacy of psychotherapy, antidepressants and their combination in adult depression at follow-up at least 12 months after termination of therapy, which could be acute phase, maintenance or relapse prevention therapy, were included. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. In total 19 RCTs with a total of 1154 participants were included. Psychotherapy was significantly superior to pharmacotherapy regarding relapse rates and Beck Depression Inventory scores at follow-up after acute treatment in two of nine RCTs. Combined treatment performed significantly better than pharmacotherapy, but not psychotherapy, regarding relapse and remission in five out of nine RCTs at least 12 months after treatment termination. Pairwise meta-analyses indicated a superiority of combined treatment compared to pharmacotherapy alone regarding relapse, recurrence, and rehospitalization rates (RR=0.60, 95%-CI: 0.37-0.97, p=.041) and for psychotherapy compared to pharmacotherapy alone regarding relapse and recurrence rates (RR=0.58, 95%-CI: 0.38-0.89, p=.023), however comparative treatment effects between psychotherapy and combined treatment were insignificant. Current findings suggest a superiority of psychotherapy and combined treatment over pharmacotherapy alone in major depressive disorder depression. Major limitations were a low number of studies reporting follow-up data after termination of study periods and a heterogeneity in definitions of treatment outcomes.

Moreover, no significant differences were found in the prevalence of ASDS before treatment between these two groups (p > 0.05). However, after treatment, the ASDS score was significantly lower in the combined group than in the conventional group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, post-management analysis revealed that the incidence rate of ASD was 24.19% in the conventional group and 8.22% in the combined group. Moreover, the incidence of ASD was significantly lower in the combined group compared to the conventional group (p < 0.05). Before intervention, the difference in the SAS or SDS between patients was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). However, following treatment, the SAS and SDS scores of patients were significantly lower in the combined group than in the conventional group (p < 0.05).

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a widely used treatment for severe depression, has recently gained attention for its potential in treating adolescent depression. Previous studies suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction is closely related to the onset of depression. Therefore, investigating the mechanism by which ECT alleviates depressive symptoms through the improvement of mitochondrial energy metabolism is of great significance. This study employed the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model to assess the effects of ECT on depression-like behaviors through the sucrose preference test, open field test, and tail suspension test. Additionally, mitochondrial energy metabolism markers, including ATP levels, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), lactate, and pyruvate, were measured in both mouse and human plasma to evaluate the effects of ECT on mitochondrial function. The results showed that ECT significantly improved depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors in mice, as evidenced by the reversal of abnormal behaviors in the sucrose preference test, open field test, and tail suspension test. Analysis of plasma mitochondrial energy metabolism markers revealed that ECT significantly increased ATP levels, restored OCR, reduced lactate accumulation, and increased pyruvate levels. These findings suggest that ECT alleviates depressive symptoms by restoring mitochondrial energy metabolism and improving brain energy supply. This study systematically explored the potential mechanism by which ECT alleviates adolescent depression through the improvement of mitochondrial energy metabolism. The results indicate that ECT not only effectively alleviates depressive symptoms but also provides new insights and experimental evidence for the treatment of adolescent depression through mitochondrial function restoration. Future research could further investigate how to combine drug treatments to enhance mitochondrial function, improve ECT efficacy, and evaluate the effects of ECT in different depression subtypes, providing guidance for personalized clinical treatment.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40361275', 'title': 'Cancer in Severe Mental Illness Patients: A Retrospective Study.', 'abstract': 'Severe mental illness (SMI), including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression, constitute a risk factor for premature death.

However, 95 % of serotonin is synthesised and used in the periphery, and TRP is also metabolised via non-5-HT routes such as the kynurenine pathway. Moreover, understanding of genotypes involved in regulation of serotonin raises questions over the generalisability of TRP effects on behaviour across individuals with varied serotonergic genotypes. To date, only differences between variants of the 5-HT transporter-linked promoter region (5-HTTLPR) have been investigated in relation to behavioural effects of TRP supplementation. Effects of 5-HTTLPR genotypes are usually compared between the alleles that are either high (L/L') or low (S/S') expressing of mRNA for the 5-HT transporter receptor. Yet, another key genetic variable is sex: in women, the S/S' genotype predicts sensitivity to improved mood and reduced cortisol by TRP supplementation, during stressful challenges, whereas the L/L' genotype protects against stress-induced mood deterioration. In men, the L/L' genotype may confer risk of stress-induced increases in negative affect; there are insufficient data to assess effects on male S/S' genotypes.

The exact etiopathogenesis of depression is not well understood. Studies have suggested that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (ILs) perform vital roles in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression. Increasing evidence suggests the upregulation of TNF-α and ILs expression in patients with depression. Therefore, biologics like TNF inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) and IL inhibitors (ustekinumab) have become key compounds in the treatment of depression. Interestingly, treatment with an antidepressant has been found to decrease the TNF-α level and improve depression-like behaviors in several preclinical and clinical studies. In the current article, we have reviewed the recent findings linking TNF-α and the pathogenesis of depression proving TNF-α inhibitors as potential new therapeutic agents. Animal models and clinical studies further support that TNF-α inhibitors are effective in ameliorating depression-like behaviors. Moreover, studies showed that peripheral injection of TNF-α exhibits depressive symptoms. These symptoms have been improved by treatment with TNF-α inhibitors.

In youth mental health, clinical staging has been increasingly applied to conditions where progression from non-specific symptoms to full-blown syndromes, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, is possible. However, novel transdiagnostic staging models have also been proposed, recognizing the limitations of current classification systems and the substantial overlap of symptoms, particularly early in the illness course. Models incorporating an appropriate developmental and transdiagnostic lens may offer significant advances for research and clinical practice, supporting early intervention and secondary prevention. This narrative review critically examines theoretical premises and empirical applications of transdiagnostic clinical staging models in youth. Peer-reviewed studies were identified in PubMed using search terms related to clinical staging, focusing on sociodemographic, cognitive, and clinical factors investigated in youth samples (12-30 years). Evidence is synthesized in three main sections: progression, extension, and stage-based treatment. Additionally, a stage-based care model and directions for future research are presented. Early findings partially support important assumptions for the model, suggesting stage-related differences in cognition and functionality. Furthermore, new extension features have been recently proposed, including substance use, circadian disturbances, and physical illnesses. The long-term outcomes of stage-based interventions remain an open question.

Here, we propose to use label-free organelle-specific phase contrast microscopy (OS-PCM) to achieve prolonged, specific observation and quantitative analysis of mitochondria dynamics during cell death with minimum perturbation to cells. Using apoptosis and ferroptosis as two examples of cell death, we show quantitatively that large mitochondria tend to increase in size through a combination of swelling and fusion in response to apoptosis, while they decrease in size through fission during ferroptosis. These results provide a new and deeper understanding of mitochondrial dynamics during cell death and demonstrate that OS-PCM is a powerful tool for the gentle, facile, and quantitative study of delicate organelles under stress.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40314834', 'title': 'Deciphering the role of circular RNAs in cancer progression under hypoxic conditions.', 'abstract': 'Hypoxia, characterized by reduced oxygen levels, plays a pivotal role in cancer progression, profoundly influencing tumor behavior and therapeutic responses. A hallmark of solid tumors, hypoxia drives significant metabolic adaptations in cancer cells, primarily mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a key transcription factor activated in low-oxygen conditions. This hypoxic environment promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing cancer cell migration, metastasis, and the development of cancer stem cell-like properties, which contribute to therapy resistance. Moreover, hypoxia modulates the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs), leading to their accumulation in the tumor microenvironment. These hypoxia-responsive circRNAs regulate gene expression and cellular processes critical for cancer progression, making them promising candidates for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in various cancers. This review delves into the intricate interplay between hypoxic circRNAs, microRNAs, and RNA-binding proteins, emphasizing their role as molecular sponges that modulate gene expression and signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. It also explores the relationship between circRNAs and the tumor microenvironment, particularly how hypoxia influences their expression and functional dynamics. Additionally, the review highlights the potential of circRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic tools, as well as their therapeutic applications in innovative cancer treatments. By consolidating current knowledge, this review underscores the critical role of circRNAs in cancer biology and paves the way for future research aimed at harnessing their unique properties for clinical advancements. Specifically, this review examines the biogenesis, expression patterns, and mechanistic actions of hypoxic circRNAs, focusing on their ability to act as molecular sponges for microRNAs and their interactions with RNA-binding proteins.

This study located a wheat dwarfing gene downstream of Rht1 on chromosome 4B through QTL mapping, called the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase alpha (PI4KA-4B). The TaPI4KA-4B gene is located on the cell membrane, and the mating based split-ubiquitin system assays (mbSUS) showed that this gene interacts with TaCSN7 (COP9 signalosome subunit 7).

While IgE targeting self-proteins has been extensively studied, IgE responses induced by human-homologous exogenous molecular allergens (HEMAs) remains less understood. To investigate whether IgE antibody responses to HEMAs are associated with AD, its severity, and response to dupilumab. We enrolled 3325 participants with a history of allergic diseases, including 577 (17.3%) diagnosed with AD. Serum IgE antibodies against 183 exogenous allergenic molecules were measured using the IgE microarray (Allergy Explorer-ALEX-2®, MADX, Vienna). Based on international classification criteria, participants were stratified by AD severity and clinical phenotypes. For each patient, we developed an 'IgE molecular-mimicry index' (IgE-MMI), calculated from IgE reactivity to a panel of five HEMA protein families: arginine kinase, enolase (ENO), cyclophilin (CYP), lipocalin, and MnSOD. Logistic regression was employed to assess the association between IgE to HEMAs or IgE-MMI and AD, its severity, and response to dupilumab. IgE sensitization to most HEMAs (32/48, 67%), but only to a small fraction of non-HEMAs (3/135, 2.2%), was significantly more common in patients with severe AD compared to other patient groups. The IgE-MMI was positive in 295/2748 (10.7%) of allergic patients without AD, and in 58/283 (20%), 52/134 (39%), and 86/160 (54%) of patients with remitting, moderate, or severe AD, respectively.

The factors influencing sex-related disparities in affective disorders as well as variations in resilience remain unclear; however, emerging evidence suggests differences in the gut microbiota play a role. In this study, using the single prolonged stress (SPS) model of post-traumatic stress disorder, we investigated pre- and post-existing differences in microbial composition, functionality, and metabolites that affect stress susceptibility or resilience in each sex. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control or SPS groups. Two weeks following SPS, the animals were exposed to a battery of behavioral tests and decapitated a day later. Based on their anxiety index, they were further categorized as SPS-resilient (SPS-R) or SPS-susceptible (SPS-S). On the day of dissection, cecum, and selected brain tissues were isolated. Stool samples were collected before and after SPS, whereas urine samples were taken before and 30\\xa0min into the SPS. Before SPS exposure, the sympathoadrenal axis exhibited alterations within male subgroups only. Expression of tight junction protein claudin-5 was lower in brain of SPS-S males, but higher in SPS-R females following SPS.

No beginning time point was specified, and the end time point was chosen as the 23rd of August 2024. Restrictions were placed on age (under 20), diagnosis (BED, LOC eating) and study design (quantitative). Ten quantitative studies were identified: eight randomised controlled trials and two case series. Outcome data for 2400 young people were synthesised. Most studies (70%) had a sample size of fewer than 100 participants. Treatment modalities were heterogeneous and included psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) and group schema therapy. One study examined the role of medication. The results suggested that six different treatment modalities (CBT (group and individual), IPT, DBT, family-based IPT (FB-IPT), and medication) were associated with a reduction in the number of binge eating episodes and LOC eating. In terms of other psychological aspects such as depression, anxiety and self-esteem, the data were sparse, and it was difficult to draw meaningful conclusions. The findings highlight a paucity of evidence-based interventions in this area for young people with BED and LOC eating. This is an emerging and important field in child and adolescent eating disorders as it is now ten years since BED was introduced into the DSM-V with prevalence estimates higher than other eating disorders in this population. As the onset of binge eating often occurs in late childhood or adolescence there is a role for early intervention.

The talking therapies used in each of the nine studies were varied. The authors found that, on the whole, talking therapy and medication helped with the number of binge eating episodes and LOC eating but it was less easy to understand if they helped with depression and anxiety which are both commonly associated with BED and LOC eating.

The stress treatments applied were: control (no stress), salinity (80 mM NaCl), alkalinity (40 mM NaHCO₃), and a combined salinity/alkalinity condition. Our results indicated that complementary light spectra, especially red and blue/red, helped mitigate the adverse effects of stress on plant growth and development. These spectra improved plant tolerance by enhancing the activity of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes and increasing starch accumulation in the leaves. Furthermore, under stress conditions, red and blue-red light significantly boosted fruit anthocyanin levels. Although stress elevated antioxidant activity, supplementary light reduced this activity by alleviating stress compared to ambient light.

This group was also identified in a Dutch psychological autopsy study among 35 relatives of adolescents (aged 10-19 years old) who died by suicide. There seems to be a lack of knowledge and consensus how to treat this severe chronic suicidal behavior, resulting in stagnation of care and growing demoralization among patients, parents, and mental health care providers. The aim of this paper is to describe characteristics of the suicidal process, to identify challenges experienced in providing mental health care for this subgroup, and to formulate preliminary recommendations. A case description from the psychological autopsy study and a review of the relevant literature. The persistent suicidal threat and the resulting despair of the patient and their parents are forcing the mental health care provider into an impasse: the primary focus of treatment slowly moves to guarantee the patient's safety, which leaves the treatment of underlying problems underexposed. Due to the chronicity of the suicidal ideation and behavior in a phase in which identity formation and developing cognitive and emotional regulation skills are important developmental tasks, we identify a risk of developing a suicidal identity. Based on expert knowledge, we make recommendations on (1) treating suicidality as a transdiagnostic phenomenon with its own meaning and function, (2) implementing treatment considerations promoting the autonomy, (3) aiming at continuity of care and prevention of repeated patient referrals by creating a multidisciplinary network of care providers, and (4) making chronic suicidality tolerable for the care provider.

BPA exposure has been associated with the development of breast cancer, and the increase in breast cancer incidence prompted us to investigate the effects of BPA in MCF10A, a model of non-transformed mammary epithelium. Cells were treated with 10\\xa0nM BPA for 24\\xa0h to capture early molecular alterations preceding phenotypic transitions. Comprehensive transcriptomic analyses were conducted to identify differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways. Subsequent validations included assessment of cytokine release, protein expression, immunofluorescence for subcellular localization of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB), and evaluation of actin cytoskeletal organization. Transcriptome analysis revealed enrichment in interleukin signaling and activation of the NF-κB pathway following BPA exposure. Functional assays demonstrated that BPA treatment enhanced cell motility, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of NF-κB. Inhibition of NF-κB effectively mitigated BPA-induced effects, including augmented cell motility, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Notably, inhibition of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway, and to a lesser extent of the AKT pathway, counteracted BPA-induced NF-κB activation and the associated increase in cell motility. In conclusion, we show that nanomolar concentration of BPA induces significant changes in the molecular setting and behaviour of non-tranformed breast cells, activating NF-κB signalling that in turn controls inflammation, cell cycle, proliferation and cell motility. Our findings indicate that nanomolar concentrations of BPA can induce significant molecular and behavioral changes in non-transformed breast epithelial cells.

Early diagnosis and a staged approach are essential to address joint destruction and restore functionality, ensuring better outcomes for patients.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40110058', 'title': 'Factors contributing to variability in neurocognitive performance before glioma neurosurgery.', 'abstract': \"Cognitive impairment following anti-tumor treatment is a common concern for brain tumor patients. However, growing evidence indicates that significant impairments can be present even before treatment. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that explain variability in pretreatment test performance, beyond that of tumor burden. Using multi-step linear regression, we retrospectively probed the contribution of clinical-, tumor-, patient-, and self-reported factors to variance in performance among 96 treatment-naïve brain tumor patients across 13 objective neurocognitive tests. Agreement between subjective and objective reports of cognitive impairment was also examined. Clinically significant preoperative impairments were observed in both objective and subjective domains. Estimated premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), tumor volume, diagnosis of an astrocytoma, self-reported depression, and perceived cognitive functioning scores were the most common predictors of objective neurocognitive performance prior to treatment, explaining 12.3%-58.3% of the variance. No association was identified between objective and subjective reports of cognitive impairment. Glioma patients frequently exhibit objective and subjective impairments prior to treatment. Both tumor- and self-reported factors were identified as predictors of performance, after correcting for estimated premorbid IQ. Nevertheless, more than 41.7% of the variance in cognitive performance remained unexplained, indicating a substantial role for additional, as yet unaccounted for, clinical factors. Notable disparity between objective and subjective cognitive impairment status re-emphasizes the importance of assessing both domains to ascertain a patient's overall functioning in the context of treatment outcomes.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39841356', 'title': 'Mitigating Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): The Role of Bioactive Phytoconstituents in Indian Culinary Spices.', 'abstract': 'The term metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) refers to a group of progressive steatotic liver conditions that include metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which has varying degrees of liver fibrosis and may advance to cirrhosis, and independent hepatic steatosis. MASLD has a complex underlying mechanism, with patients exhibiting diverse causes and phases of the disease. India has a pool prevalence of MASLD of 38.6% in adults. In 2023, the term NAFLD has been redefined and changed to MASLD. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of MASLD. This study investigates the potential of bioactive phytoconstituents present in spices as a therapeutic approach for MASLD. Moreover, it offers comprehensive data on several pre-clinical studies of bioactive phytoconstituents derived from spices that primarily focus on treating obesity-associated MASLD. Spices include a high amount of bioactive chemicals and several research have indicated their diverse pharmacological activities. Bioactive phytoconstituents from common Indian spices like cinnamic acid, eugenol, curcumin, allicin, 6-gingerols, capsaicin, piperine, eucalyptol, trigonelline, and linalool have been reported to exhibit anti-MASLD effects both in-vivo and in-vitro. Bioactive phytoconstituents from different culinary species of India have shown promising potential against MASLD in pre-clinical status. Further clinical studies on a large scale would be beneficial for paving the path to the development of a new drug which is the need of time.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40371698', 'title': 'Natural product sennoside B disrupts liquid-liquid phase separation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by inhibiting its RNA-binding activity.', 'abstract': 'The nucleocapsid protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2, an RNA-binding protein, is capable of undergoing liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) during viral infection, which plays a crucial role in virus assembly, replication, and immune regulation. In this study, we developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2\\u2009NP-RNA interaction. Using this HTRF-based approach, we identified two natural products, sennoside A and sennoside B, as effective blockers of this interaction. Bio-layer interferometry assays confirmed that both sennosides directly bind to the NP, with binding sites located within the C-terminal domain. Additionally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that sennoside B significantly inhibited RNA-induced LLPS of the NP, while sennoside A displayed comparatively weaker activity. Thus, the developed HTRF-based assay is a valuable tool for identifying novel compounds that disrupt the RNA-binding activity and LLPS of the SARS-CoV-2\\u2009NP. Our findings may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 NP.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34959434', 'title': 'Prevention of Stress-Induced Depressive-like Behavior by Saffron Extract Is Associated with Modulation of Kynurenine Pathway and Monoamine Neurotransmission.', 'abstract': \"Depressive disorders are a major public health concern.

Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus), a probiotic, has been reported to be effective against blastocystosis. The present study evaluated the therapeutic and prophylactic effectiveness of L. acidophilus compared to metronidazole (MTZ) in rats experimentally infected with Blastocystis subtype 3 (ST3). Four groups of Blastocystis ST3-infected rats received MTZ, L. acidophilus, both MTZ and L. acidophilus, or prophylactic L. acidophilus. Non-infected and infected control groups were included. The effectiveness of treatment and prevention was evaluated using parasitological monitoring, histopathological examination, immunohistochemical staining for TNF-α and IgA expression, and immunological testing for TNF-α and IL-10. In the L. acidophilus-treated group, a 76% reduction in the mean fecal parasitic count and a 67% clearance in the intestinal wash were achieved aligning closely with outcomes observed in the MTZ-treated group. An immunomodulatory impact via upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and downregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α was demonstrated as well. Combined administration of MTZ and L. acidophilus exhibited superior efficacy with a 99% decrease in the mean fecal parasitic count and a 98% decrease in the intestinal fluid parasitic count. Additionally, the lowest TNF-α and the highest IL-10 serum levels. Prophylactic use of L. acidophilus for 7 days neither prevented infection nor reduced its severity. Furthermore, no significant differences were detected in serum levels of TNF-α and IL-10 following post-prophylaxis and\\xa0post-treatment\\xa0with L. acidophilus. Accordingly, L. acidophilus might be recommended as an adjuvant treatment alongside MTZ for improved efficacy against blastocystosis.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40252366', 'title': 'Unlocking the potential of novel tetrahydro-β-carboline-based HDAC6 inhibitors for colorectal cancer therapy: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation.', 'abstract': 'Altered histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) expression and function have been linked to cancer progression, positioning it as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
