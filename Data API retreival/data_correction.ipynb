This guideline aims to update the existing joint European consensus on delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) in adult glioblastoma patients. The ESTRO Guidelines Committee identified 14 European experts in close interaction with the ESTRO clinical committee and EANO who discussed and analysed the body of evidence concerning contemporary glioblastoma target delineation, then took part in a two-step modified Delphi process to address open questions. Several key issues were identified and are discussed including i) pre-treatment steps and immobilisation, ii) target delineation and the use of standard and novel imaging techniques, and iii) technical aspects of treatment including planning techniques and fractionation. Based on the EORTC recommendation focusing on the resection cavity and residual enhancing regions on T1-sequences with the addition of a reduced 15\\xa0mm margin, special situations are presented with corresponding potential adaptations depending on the specific clinical situation. The EORTC consensus recommends a single clinical target volume definition based on postoperative contrast-enhanced T1 abnormalities, using isotropic margins without the need to cone down.

       "   'text': 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive malignant form of brain tumour in adults and is characterized by an extremely poor prognosis with dismal survival rates. Currently, expanding concepts concerning the pathophysiology of GBM are inextricably linked with neuroinflammatory phenomena. On account of this fact, the identification of novel pathomechanisms targeting neuroinflammation seems to be crucial in terms of yielding successful individual therapeutic strategies. In recent years, the pleiotropic growth factor progranulin (PGRN) has attracted significant attention in the neuroscience and oncological community regarding its neuroimmunomodulatory and oncogenic functions. This review of the literature summarizes and updates contemporary knowledge about PGRN, its associated receptors and signalling pathway involvement in GBM pathogenesis, indicating possible cellular and molecular mechanisms with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets in order to yield successful individual therapeutic strategies. After a review of the literature, we found that there are possible PGRN-targeted therapeutic approaches for implementation in GBM treatment algorithms both in preclinical and future clinical studies. Furthermore, PGRN-targeted therapies exerted their highest efficacy in combination with other established chemotherapeutic agents, such as temozolomide. The results of the analysis suggested that the possible implementation of routine determinations of PGRN and its associated receptors in tumour tissue and biofluids could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of GBM. Furthermore, promising preclinical applications of PGRN-related findings should be investigated in clinical studies in order to create new diagnostic and t',\n",

For each trial, fifty high-quality photon plans were utilized to build a KBP photon model. A KBP proton model was generated using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans generated on 50 patients originally treated with photon RT. These models were then applied to generate KBP plans for the remaining patients, which were compared against the submitted plans for quality evaluation, including in terms of protocol compliance, target coverage, and organ-at-risk (OAR) doses.

       "   'text': 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant type of glioma. GBM tumors grow rapidly, have a high degree of malignancy, and are characterized by a fast disease progression. Unfortunately, there is a lack of effective treatments. An effective strategy for the treatment of GBM would be to identify key biomarkers correlating with the occurrence and progression of GBM and developing these biomarkers into therapeutic targets. In this study, using integrated bioinformatics analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 130 genes that were upregulated in GBM compared to normal brain tissue, and 128 genes that were downregulated in GBM. Based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, these genes were associated with regulation of tumor cell adhesion, differentiation, morphology in GBM and were mainly enriched in Complement and coagulation cascades pathway. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database was used to construct a Protein-Protein Interaction network. Ten hub genes were identified, including FN1, CD44, MYC, CDK1, SERPINE1, COL3A1, COL1A2, LOX, POSTN and EZH2, all of which were significantly upregulated in GBM, these results were confirmed by oncomine database exploration. Alteration analysis of hub genes found that patients with alteration in at least one of the hub genes showed shorter median survival times (p\\xa0=\\xa00.013) and shorter median disease-free survival times (p\\xa0=\\xa02.488E-3) than patients without alterations in any of the hub genes. Multiple tests for survival analysis showed that among individual hub genes only expression of LOX was correlated with patient survival (P < 0.05).GDS4467 data set was used to analyze the expression of LOX in gliomas with different degrees of malignancy, and it was found that the expression level of LOX was positively correlated with the malignant degree of gliomas.By analyzing GDS 4535 data set showed that the expression level of LOX was positively correlated with the differentiation degree of GBM cells CONCLUSION: This research suggests that FN1, CD44, MYC, CDK1, SERPINE1, COL3A1, COL1A2, LOX, POSTN and EZH2 are key genes in GBM. However, only LOX is correlated with patient survival and promotes glioblastoma cell differentiation and tumor recurrence. LOX may be a c',\n",
