Thus, the identification of peptide antigens that can elicit an immune response is of immense importance for developing successful therapies for bacterial and viral infections, even cancer. Recently, studies have demonstrated the importance of peptide-MHC (pMHC) structural analysis, with pMHC structural modeling methods gradually becoming more popular in peptide antigen identification workflows. Most of the pMHC structural modeling tools provide an ensemble of candidate peptide poses in the MHC-I cleft, each associated with a score stemming from a scoring function, with the top scoring pose assumed to be the most representative of the ensemble. However, identifying the binding mode, that is, the peptide pose from the ensemble that is closer to an unavailable native structure, is not trivial. Oftentimes, the peptide poses characterized as best by a protein-ligand scoring function are not the ones that are the most representative of the actual structure. In this work, we frame the peptide binding pose identification problem as a Learning-to-Rank (LTR) problem. We present RankMHC, an LTR-based pMHC binding mode identification predictor, which is specifically trained to predict the most accurate ranking of an ensemble of pMHC conformations.

These conditions may not be relevant to 3-D tumor tissue in vivo and the importance of apoptosis for tumor response is controversial. We here studied the effects of cisplatin on a 3-D colon carcinoma in vitro model (multicellular spheroids). Cisplatin at a dose of 40 microM induced active caspase-3 preferentially in the peripheral 30 microm cell layer of spheroids, mainly during late stages (72-96 hr). The p53 response to cisplatin was also largely confined to peripheral cell layers. Despite the use of a high cisplatin concentration, a significant fraction of the cells in the spheroids survived treatment. A high proportion of surviving cells stained positive for beta-galactosidase, a marker of premature senescence.

The uptake and detection rate of clinically significant neoplasia with CCE, compared with colonoscopy, remain unclear in this setting. The primary objective of this study was to compare the detection rates of advanced neoplasia between CCE and colonoscopy, using a pathway in which the study group could choose between the two procedures, while the control group was offered only colonoscopy. A randomised, intention-to-treat trial was conducted among Danish CRC screening participants who tested positive with a faecal immunochemical test (FIT). The trial compared the detection rate of advanced neoplasia (primary outcome) and the uptake rate of both approaches between the two arms. A total of 473\\u2009684 invitations were sent to 396\\u2009676 individuals, with 62.6% returning the test.

Among FIT-positive cases, the uptake for colonoscopy was 91.1% in the control arm and 91.7% in the study arm, where participants had a choice of methods. In the study arm, 45.8% preferred CCE, 11.4% preferred colonoscopy and 42.8% had no preference and underwent colonoscopy. Ultimately, 69.9% of patients who initially opted for CCE were later referred for colonoscopy. The rate of advanced neoplasia detection was similar between the groups: 0.67% in the study arm versus 0.64% in the control arm. Offering CCE as an alternative to colonoscopy did not significantly alter the detection rate of advanced neoplasia, nor did it increase uptake in a screening programme with high adherence to colonoscopy following a positive FIT test. Instead, it led to a very high rate of secondary colonoscopies. Therefore, CCE cannot be recommended in this setting.

Most patients were also tested serologically for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). As evaluated on light microscopy, most (74%, 95/128) of the lesions were exophytic (papillary) acuminate warts, 15% (19) were flat, and 11% (14) were pigmented papulous lesions. No signs of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) were seen in 70% (90) of the 128 biopsy specimens (NAIN), 27% (35) were classified as showing AIN I, and another 2% (three) as AIN II. AIN was significantly (p less than 0.05) more often associated with papulous lesions, only 43% (6/14) of which showed NAIN compared with 72% (68/98) of acuminate condylomas. The duration of disease was directly related to the presence and severity of AIN in the lesions; thus in 47 lesions that had been present for more than 12 months, NAIN was found in 31 (66%), AIN I in 14 (30%), and AIN II in two (4%). HPV DNA of at least one of the six types tested for was detected in 109/125 (87%) lesions. HPV 6 and HPV 11 were the two most common types, comprising 57% (62) and 37% (40), respectively, of the 109 HPV DNA positive cases. Only seven (6%) biopsy specimens were associated with any of HPV types 16, 18, 31, or 33, which carry a high risk of potential malignant transformation. No association was found between sexual preferences of patients and the incidence of any of the various HPV types. Neither did the distribution of the various HPV types differ between men with antibody to HIV and those without antibody. All the men with antibody to HIV were homosexual or bisexual. On microscopy, 93% (38) of 41 lesions containing HPV 11 and 75% (48/64) of HPV 6 lesions were of the acuminate wart type; in comparison, the remaining 16 HPV 6 lesions were equally either flat or papulous (eight, 13% each). Of the 64 HPV 6 and 41 HPV 11 associated lesions, 73% (47) and 63% (26), respectively, were classified as NAIN. Only two lesions were associated with HPV 16, and both showed mild dysplasia. On the other hand, two HPV 6 induced lesions were associated with AIN II. No differences were found between HPV 6 and HPV 11 in duration of disease; (39%, and 27% respectively, had been present for more than 12 months). The results showed that overt anal wart disease was associated with HPV types 6 and 11 in most cases. Although HPV types considered as being of higher oncogenic potential were detected relatively rarely, the associated AIN in a relatively high proportion (31% 32/105) of HPV 6 or 11 induced lesions indicated that a malignant potential, even for HPV 11 associated anal warts, cannot be excluded.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25683705', 'title': 'Novel molecular insights from routine genotyping of colorectal carcinomas.', 'abstract': 'Routine tumor genotyping enables identification of concurrent mutations in tumors and reveals low-frequency mutations that may be associated with a particular tumor phenotype.

Blood specimens were obtained from the drainage vein of the tumor during operation in 76 patients with colorectal cancer. Serum ROS levels were measured using the derivative-Reactive Oxygen Metabolites (d-ROM) test and serum TP levels were examined by a highly sensitive ELISA method. There was no significant correlation between serum levels of ROS and TP. Serum ROS levels were elevated in proportion to tumor invasion and had a significant positive correlation with tumor size (p < 0.05). However, they did not increase in patients with liver metastasis. These findings suggest that ROS are independent of TP-triggered signaling transduction and are associated with increased tumor invasion, but not liver metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer.

We performed 14 qualitative research interviews with 12 patients (four men and eight women, aged 41-85 years) undergoing surgery for peritoneal metastases; five of these were together with a relative. Five of the participants had ovarian, and seven had colorectal cancer (four men and seven women). The interviews followed a semistructured interview guide, were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using meaning condensation. Patients accepted the surgeon's decision of refraining from the intended surgery. During the postoperative period, when realising the prognostic consequences, their needs changed rapidly, in some cases from day to day, and gradually they developed a reoriented focus on their lives. The findings were framed by two themes dealing with 'Change in treatment strategy' and 'Physical and psychosocial aspects of not undergoing curative surgery'. When curative cancer surgery is not completed as intended, patient-centred communication is essential for patients' psychosocial reorientation and quality of life. Further, to support their well-being and action competences, patients have a need for basic supportive care and physical restitution.

There is now strong evidence that systemic immunological parameters do not correlate with therapeutic activity. In contrast, information on therapy related immunological change at the tumour site is scarce. Having previously demonstrated that the therapeutic activity of doxorubicin chemotherapy can be significantly augmented by the co-administration of two cytokines, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), the objective of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of action of this enhanced therapeutic activity by characterising the effect of single, double and triple agent therapy upon local tumour immune parameters. Twenty-four hours after the administration of treatment to WAG rats bearing solid tumour implants of a colonic adenocarcinoma, the extent of tumour infiltration in response to the therapy was assessed in haematoxylin and eosin stained tumour sections. Treatment with doxorubicin/IL-2/IFN-gamma or IL-2/IFN-gamma was associated with a marked augmentation of the size of the tumour infiltrate (P < 0.001), as compared to untreated tumours or to those treated with any other single or double agent combination. Phenotypic evaluation of the tumour infiltrate using immunoperoxidase stained tumour sections revealed that a considerable proportion of the infiltrating cells were T cells and macrophages, whilst B cells were not detected in significant numbers. Although this phenotypic profile was not qualitatively influenced by therapy, marked quantitative differences were observed. Most notably, tumours treated with either doxorubicin/IL-2/IFN-gamma or IL-2/IFN-gamma exhibited a significant increase in the numbers of CD25+ infiltrating cells (P < 0.001). These changes in the tumour immunological response closely paralleled the therapeutic responses described previously. Thus, the enhanced therapeutic activity of the triple agent regimen may result from a profound augmentation of the size of the tumour infiltrate, together with a similar increase in the numbers of activated infiltrating cells. This study supports the concept that the immune response within the tumour is the appropriate site for investigations into the immunological antitumour mechanisms of immunotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35128131', 'title': 'Colorectal Surgery in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era.', 'abstract': \"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread at a very fast rate, overwhelming and disrupting healthcare systems around the world since its outbreak in December 2019 in China.

The gene expression patterns in normal colon and liver were successfully distinguished from those in CRCs; however, RNA sequencing revealed that the gene expression between primary CRCs and their matched liver metastases is highly similar. We identified 1895 genes that were differentially expressed in the primary carcinoma and liver metastases, than that in the normal colon tissues. A major proportion of the transcripts, identified by gene expression profiling as significantly enriched in the primary carcinoma and metastases, belonged to gene ontology categories involved in the cell cycle, mitosis, and cell division. Furthermore, we identified gene fusion events in primary carcinoma and metastases, and the fusion transcripts were experimentally confirmed. Among these, a chimeric transcript resulting from the fusion of RNF43 and SUPT4H1 was found to occur frequently in primary colorectal carcinoma.

Only patients who required re-endoscopy were included for analysis. For identified patients, we collected demographic data, clinical courses, characteristics of colorectal lesions, and procedure-related variables.

This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively designed, population-based cancer registry (The Netherlands Cancer Registry). Patients with a stage I, II, or III colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2008 were included. Cumulative incidence, standardized incidence ratio, and absolute excess risk for second primary cancers in subsites of the colon and rectum were estimated for follow-up periods of 2 to 5, 6 to 10, and more than 10 years after the index cancer in patients older than 50 years and in those aged 50 years or younger. A total of 123,347 patients had a first invasive colorectal cancer diagnosed between 1989 and 2008. Of these, 1849 patients (1.5%) had a second colorectal lesion that was found more than 1 year after the initial cancer and diagnosed as a second primary colorectal cancer. In patients older than 50 years, the 20-year cumulative incidence for second cancers was 3.4% in the proximal colon, 1.2% in the distal colon, and 1.2% in the rectum. More than 60% of second cancers occurred within 5 years after the index cancer.

The corresponding absolute excess risks per 10 000 person years were 9 in the proximal colon, 0.1 in the distal colon, and 1 in the rectum. After 5 years of follow-up, elevated risk was observed only in the proximal colon. A similar risk pattern was observed in patients younger than 50 years. The absolute excess risk for a second cancer in the proximal colon increased over time. The proportion of stage III and stage IV second cancers increased from 31% during the first 5 years of follow-up to 38% after 10 years of follow-up.

However, the molecular mechanism associated with the MC-LR-induced CRC progression remains elusive. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of the hub genes associated with MC-LR-induced CRC development at the molecular, cellular and clinical levels through bioinformatics and traditional experiments. By utilizing R, we screened and investigated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the MC-LR and the control groups with the GEO, in which, HOXB4 highly expressed in MC-LR-treated group was identified and further explored as a hub gene. With the aid of TCGA, GEPIA, HPA, UALCAN, Cistrome, and TIMER, the increased mRNA and protein levels of HOXB4 in CRC tissue were found to be positively associated with high tumor stage and poor prognosis, and were linked to immune infiltration, especially tumor-associated macrophages and cancer-associated fibroblasts. Cox regression analysis and nomogram prediction model indicated that high HOXB4 expression was correlated to poor survival probability. To elucidate the mechanism of high HOXB4 expression induced by MC-LR, we overlapped the genes involved in the MC-LR-mediated CRC pathways and the HOXB4-correlated transcription genes. Importantly, C-myc instead of PPARG and RUNX1 promoted the high expression of HOXB4 through experiment validation, and was identified as a key target gene. Interestingly, C-myc was up-regulated by HOXB4 and maintained cell cycle progression. In addition, MC-LR was proved to up-regulate HOXB4 expression, thus promoting proliferation and migration of Caco2 cells and driving the cell cycle progression. In conclusion, MC-LR might accelerate CRC progression. In the process, MC-LR induced C-myc augmentation elevates the high expression of HOXB4 through increasing the S phase cell proportion to enhance Caco2 cell proliferation. Therefore, HOXB4 might be considered as a potential prognostic biomarker for CRC.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34807960', 'title': 'Fusion of KATZ measure and space projection to fast probe potential lncRNA-disease associations in bipartite graphs.', 'abstract': 'It is well known that numerous long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) closely relate to the physiological and pathological processes of human diseases and can serves as potential biomarkers.

However, inaccurate construction of similarity networks and inadequate numbers of observed known lncRNA-disease associations, such inherent problems make many mature computational methods that have been developed for many years still exit some limitations. It motivates us to explore a new computational method that was fused with KATZ measure and space projection to fast probing potential lncRNA-disease associations (namely KATZSP). KATZSP is comprised of following key steps: combining all the global information with which to change Boolean network of known lncRNA-disease associations into the weighted networks; changing the similarities calculation into counting the number of walks that connect lncRNA nodes and disease nodes in bipartite graphs; obtaining the space projection scores to refine the primary prediction scores. The process to fuse KATZ measure and space projection was simplified and uncomplicated with needing only one attenuation factor. The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) experimental results showed that, compared with other state-of-the-art methods (NCPLDA, LDAI-ISPS and IIRWR), KATZSP had a higher predictive accuracy shown with area-under-the-curve (AUC) value on the three datasets built, while KATZSP well worked on inferring potential associations related to new lncRNAs (or isolated diseases).

Multivariable analysis revealed that subclonal ANK1 mutations, clonal CASP8 mutations, and clonal SMAD2 mutations independently predicted for shorter overall survival after adjusting for clinicopathological factors. The poor outcome of the subclonal ANK1 mutation may be caused by upregulation of IL4I1, IDO1, IFNG and MAPK12 which showed potential roles in tumor immune evasion through accumulation of immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells.

Stepwise demonstration of the technique with narrated video footage. To date there is agreement that discoid resection should be the first choice procedure in patients eligible for surgical treatment with rectal, unifocal DENs measuring â¤ 3 cm [1-3]. For surgical management of lesions of the sigmoid colon, current international guidelines suggest to perform segmental resections [3]. Data on surgical treatment of multiple colorectal DENs separated by a great distance from each other are very limited, mostly owing to the rarity of such a diagnosis. In particular, there is paucity of data concerning the efficacy and safety of a double discoid resection for surgical management of distinct DENs found in the sigmoid colon and rectum [4]. In a context of multiple colorectal DENs, the decision-making process with respect to a double discoid excision must take into consideration both the distance between the 2 nodules and the nodules' distance from anal verge. When technically feasible, such organ-sparing surgery allows preserving the healthy bowel interposed between the endometriotic lesions, seeming to offer advantages in terms of quicker return of bowel function and better rectal functional outcomes than segmental colorectal resection. The patient was a 36-year-old woman experiencing drug treatment failure and presenting with refractory constipation, dyschezia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, cyclical abdominal bloating, and chronic pelvic pain. Preoperative ultrasonography revealed the presence of an endometriotic nodule of 19\\xa0Ã\\xa06\\xa0Ã\\xa016 mm deeply infiltrating the tunica muscularis of the sigmoid colon. A second DEN was found at the level of the rectum, the latter measuring 19\\xa0Ã\\xa05\\xa0Ã\\xa012 mm and having a distance of 9 cm from the anal verge. Both the intestinal lesions resulted to have a circumferential extent of 30%. The distance between the 2 nodules was 15 cm. A 3-dimensional laparoscopy was performed. Sigmoid colon and rectal mobilization were performed according to our standardized technique [5-7]. A 31-mm circular stapler was used to excise first the nodule of the sigmoid colon. The stapler, in its closed position, was gently introduced into the rectum via the anus and then progressively advanced inside the large bowel up to the level of the sigmoid nodule. After correct positioning, the stapler was completely opened and the nodule was imbricate between the anvil and staple housing of the stapler. Then, the stapler was closed and fired. The procedure was repeated using a second 31 mm circular stapler to resect the rectal endometriotic nodule. The overall operative time was 90 minutes. The estimated blood loss was 5 mL. Neither intra- nor postoperative complications occurred. The patient was discharged 3 days after surgery. The sigmoid colon and rectal endometriotic nodules measured, respectively, 20\\xa0Ã\\xa06\\xa0Ã\\xa015 mm and 20\\xa0Ã\\xa05\\xa0Ã\\xa012 mm on fresh unfixed specimens. Both nodules were found to have endometriosis-free surgical margins on definitive pathology. The operative technique displayed in this video may contribute to the standardization of a procedure, which could be included among the options available in the surgical armamentarium, to be used in selected cases of multiple colorectal DENs each having 3 cm or less in diameter.

Of 859 cancer screening QI projects (452 for breast cancer, 134 for colorectal cancer, 244 for lung cancer, and 29 for cervical cancer) conducted by 786 accredited cancer programs, 676 projects (79%) reached their target MTV. There were no hospital characteristics associated with increased likelihood of reaching target MTV except for disease site (lung vs breast, odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.7 to 4.7). During the preintervention period (April to May 2021), there was a decrease in the mean MTV (slope, -13.1 tests per month; 95% CI, -23.1 to -3.2 tests per month). Interventions were associated with a significant immediate (slope, 101.0 tests per month; 95% CI, 49.1 to 153.0 tests per month) and sustained (slope, 36.3 tests per month; 95% CI, 5.3 to 67.3 tests per month) increase in MTVs relative to the preintervention trends. Additional screening tests were performed during the intervention period compared with the prepandemic period (170 748 tests), the pandemic period (210 450 tests), and the preintervention period (722 427 tests). In this QI study, participation in a national Return-to-Screening collaborative with a multifaceted QI intervention was associated with improvements in cancer screening.

This study investigates primary care physician (PCP) behaviour and systems that may contribute to the timeliness of investigating for cancer and subsequently, international survival differences. A validated survey administered to PCPs via the internet set out in two parts: direct questions on primary care structure and practice relating to cancer diagnosis, and clinical vignettes, assessing management of scenarios relating to the diagnosis of lung, colorectal or ovarian cancer. 2795 PCPs in 11 jurisdictions: New South Wales and Victoria (Australia), British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario (Canada), England, Northern Ireland, Wales (UK), Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Analysis compared the cumulative proportion of PCPs in each jurisdiction opting to investigate or refer at each phase for each vignette with 1-year survival, and conditional 5-year survival rates for the relevant cancer and jurisdiction. Logistic regression was used to explore whether PCP characteristics or system differences in each jurisdiction affected the readiness to investigate. 4 of 5 vignettes showed a statistically significant correlation (p<0.05 or better) between readiness to investigate or refer to secondary care at the first phase of each vignette and cancer survival rates for that jurisdiction. No consistent associations were found between readiness to investigate and selected PCP demographics, practice or health system variables. We demonstrate a correlation between the readiness of PCPs to investigate symptoms indicative of cancer and cancer survival rates, one of the first possible explanations for the variation in cancer survival between ICBP countries. No specific health system features consistently explained these findings. Some jurisdictions may consider lowering thresholds for PCPs to investigate for cancer-either directly, or by specialist referral, to improve outcomes.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37991571', 'title': 'The role of the multidisciplinary tumor board after endoscopic resection of malignant tumors: is it worth it?', 'abstract': 'The value of multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer patients is well known. Most of the current evidence focuses on advanced cancer cases, whereas little is known about the effect of MTBs on early tumors, especially after endoscopic resection. The aim of our study is to evaluate the value of the MTB after endoscopic resection of malignant tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. We retrospectively analyzed all endoscopically resected malignant tumors in our department between 2011 and 2019, focusing on the existence of an MDT recommendation after endoscopic resection, the MDT adherence to the current guidelines, and the implementation of the recommendation by the patients. We identified 198 patients fulfilling our inclusion criteria, of whom 168 (85%) were discussed in the MDT after endoscopic resection. In total, 155 of the recommendations (92%) were in accordance with the current guidelines, and 147 (88%) of them were implemented by the patients. The MDT discussion itself did not influence the overall survival, whereas the implementation of the MTB recommendation was associated with a significantly better prognosis. Deviations of the MDT recommendation from the guidelines had no effect on the overall survival. The discussion of endoscopically resected malignant tumors in the MTB is crucial for the treatment of patients with this type of cancer, since the implementation of the MTB recommendation, even if it deviates from the current guidelines, improves the prognosis.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20495917', 'title': 'Phase I/II study of irinotecan, UFT and leucovorin with hepatic arterial infusion using 5-FU in colorectal cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases.', 'abstract': 'To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of systemic chemotherapy with irinotecan (CPT-11), UFT and leucovorin (LV) combined with hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) consisting of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases.

Study 1 used a between-participants design comparing four conditions: relief-based narrative, regret-based narrative, control (test-uptake only) narrative, and standard invitation material (no-narrative condition). Study 2 used a mixed design, with the narrative content as a within-participants factor and whether emotions were expressed by the narrative character or not as between-participants factor. The main outcome measures were: intention to undergo testing (Studies 1 and 2), knowledge, risk perception, proportion of informed choices (Study 1), subjective emotional responses, changes in skin conductance, heart rate, and corrugator muscle activity (Study 2). In Study 1, relative to the non-narrative condition (51%), only the relief-based narrative significantly increased intention to undergo testing (86%). Relative to the standard invitation material, the narrative conditions did not decrease knowledge, alter risk perception, or decrease the proportion of informed choices. In Study 2, the relief-based narrative elicited the lowest self-reported negative affect, and received greater implicit attention, as suggested by the larger heart rate decrease. Making the emotions experienced by the narrative character explicit decreased negative affect, as indicated by the lower skin conductance and corrugator responses during reading.

In this prospective single-arm observational pilot study, patients with a least one polyp 10-15 mm were included. These polyps were preferably removed by CSP using a dedicated hybrid snare. The primary outcome was the histological complete resection rate (CRR) determined by pathologically negative margins of the specimen and no neoplastic tissue obtained from biopsies of the resection site margin. Secondary outcomes were en bloc resection rate, failure of CSP, and incidence of adverse events. A total of 61 neoplastic polyps were removed from 39 patients. Overall CRR was 80.3% (49/61). CSP was feasible in 78.7% (48/61) of polyps and the CRR in this group was 85.4% (41/48). When CSP failed (13/61; 21.3%), lesions were successfully resected by immediate HSP using the same snare with a CRR of 61.5% (8/13) in this group. One patient presented delayed hemorrhage after HSP of a polyp but successful hemostasis was achieved with two hemoclips. No other adverse events occurred. No recurrence was seen on follow-up colonoscopy in cases with incomplete resected polyps. CSP seems to be efficient and safe in removing colorectal polyps up to 15 mm. A hybrid snare seems to be particularly advantageous for these polyps as it allows immediate conversion to HSP if CSP might fail in larger polyps.

Their molecular characteristics are still undefined. This study aimed to explore the underlying genetic basis and heterogeneity of GI-NECs. Comprehensive genomic analysis using whole-exome sequencing was performed on 143 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of surgically resected GI-NEC with a thorough histological evaluation. Mutational signatures, somatic mutations, and copy number aberrations were analyzed and compared across anatomic locations and histological subtypes. Survival analysis was conducted to identify the independent factors. In total, 143 GI-NECs were examined: the stomach, 87 cases (60.8%); the esophagus, 29 cases (20.3%); the colorectum, 20 cases (14.0%); and the small intestine, 7 cases (4.9%). Eighty-three (58.0%) and 60 (42.0%) cases were subclassified into small cell and large cell subtypes, respectively. GI-NECs showed distinct genetic alterations from their lung counterparts and non-neuroendocrine carcinomas in the same locations. Obvious heterogeneity of mutational signatures, somatic mutations, and copy number variations was revealed across anatomic locations rather than histological subtypes. Except for tumor protein p53 (TP53) and retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), the most frequently mutated genes in the stomach, esophagus, colorectum, and small intestine were low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1B (LRP1B), notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1), adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC), catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1), respectively. Mutations in the WNT-Î²-catenin, NOTCH and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene B (ERBB) pathways were prevalently identified in gastric, esophageal, and colorectal NECs, respectively. Importantly, 104 (72.7%) GI-NECs harbored putative clinically relevant alterations, and non-gastric location and RB1 bi-allelic inactivation with copy number alterations were identified as two independent poor prognostic factors. Furthermore, we found that tumor cells in GI-NECs first gain clonal mutations in TP53, RB1, NOTCH1 and APC, followed by subsequent whole-genome doubling (WGD) and post-WGD clonal mutations in LRP1B, CUB and Sushi multiple domains 3 (CSMD3), FAT tumor suppressor homolog 4 (FAT4) and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4 (ERBB4), and finally develop subclonal mutations. GI-NECs harbor distinct genomic landscapes and demonstrate significant genetic heterogeneity across different anatomic locations. Moreover, potentially actionable alterations and prognostic factors were revealed for GI-NECs.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25644977', 'title': 'Human papillomavirus in the HIV-infected host: epidemiology and pathogenesis in the antiretroviral era.', 'abstract': 'Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is associated with essentially all cervical cancers, 80-90\\xa0% of anal cancers, and a high proportion of oropharyngeal, vaginal, penile, and vulvar cancers.

The incidence of anal cancer in particular has markedly risen during the antiretroviral era due to the increased longevity of patients with HIV and the absence of anal malignancy screening programs. HIV infection may facilitate initial HPV infection by disrupting epithelial cell tight junctions. Once infection is established, HIV may promote HSIL development via the up-regulation of HPV oncogene expression and impairment of the immune response needed to clear the lesion.

Two alternative groups of carcinomas, termed LOH+ and RER+, have been defined on the basis of their genetic anomalies, a biallelic inactivation of the APC or the TGF-betaRII genes, occurring as an alternative, in LOH+ or RER+ tumors. It is a generally accepted hypothesis that most of colorectal cancers (CRC) develop from a pre-existing adenomatous polyp. Such benign lesions are usually exophytic polyps, a small proportion of adenomas having been described as flat lesions. The latter histological category has thus been proposed to bear specific genetic alterations. In order to examine this hypothesis, we have characterized a series of 44 flat colorectal neoplasias for their RER status and for somatic APC, KRAS and TGF-betaRII genes mutations. Flat colorectal neoplasias were found to be of the RER+ subtype in 22% of cases, all of them exhibiting a TGF-betaRII mutation. A mutation of the APC and KRAS genes has been found in 42% and 4% of tumors, respectively, none of these tumors being of the RER+ subtype. With the exception of a low KRAS mutation rate, flat adenomas appear to follow tumorigenesis pathways very similar to those identified in exophytic adenomas and carcinomas.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28443264', 'title': 'Cancer incidence attributable to alcohol consumption in Alberta in 2012.', 'abstract': \"Alcohol consumption has been associated with risk of oral cavity/pharyngeal, laryngeal, esophageal, liver, colorectal and breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion and total number of these cancers in Alberta in 2012 attributable to alcohol consumption. We estimated cancers attributable to alcohol consumption in adults in Alberta using population attributable risk calculations. Relative risks were obtained from recent meta-analyses, and alcohol consumption in Alberta was quantified with the use of data from the Canadian Community Health Survey. We obtained age-, site- and sex-specific cancer incidence data for 2012 from the Alberta Cancer Registry. The impact of potential underestimation of alcohol consumption in Canadian Community Health Survey data was evaluated with the use of per-capita alcohol sales data from Statistics Canada. Proportions of cancers attributable to alcohol consumption at individual cancer sites were estimated to be as low as 5.1% (liver) and as high as 19.9% (oral cavity/pharynx) among men and as low as 2.1% (liver) and as high as 7.6% (oral cavity/pharynx) among women in Alberta. The total number of alcohol-attributable cancer cases was highest for common cancers (colorectal, female breast), whereas at individual cancer sites, population attributable risks were highest for upper aerodigestive tract cancers. A total of 4.8% of alcohol-associated cancers (1.6% of all cancers) in Alberta could be attributed to alcohol consumption. After adjustment for recorded alcohol consumption, our estimates of population attributable risk increased to 10.7% of alcohol-associated cancers and 3.5% of all cancers. Alcohol consumption is estimated to account for 1.6%-3.5% of total cancer cases in Alberta. Given that no level of alcohol consumption is considered safe with respect to cancer risk, strategies to reduce alcohol consumption have the potential to reduce Alberta's cancer burden.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152824', 'title': 'Colorectal Cancer Trends of 2018 in Romania-an Important Geographical Variation Between Northern and Southern Lands and High Mortality Versus European Averages.', 'abstract': 'In Romania, one of the highest rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in Europe was estimated based on data available in 2008.

However, the heterogeneous nature of polyps and differences in lighting and visibility conditions present significant challenges in achieving reliable and consistent segmentation across different cases. Therefore, this study proposes a novel dynamic spectrum-driven hierarchical learning model (DSHNet), the first to specifically leverage image frequency domain information to explore region-level salience differences among and within polyps for precise segmentation. A novel spectral decoupler is advanced to separate low-frequency and high-frequency components, leveraging their distinct characteristics to guide the model in learning valuable frequency features without bias through automatic masking. The low-frequency driven region-level saliency modeling then generates dynamic convolution kernels with individual frequency-aware features, which regulate region-level saliency modeling together with the supervision of the hierarchy of labels, thus enabling adaptation to polyp heterogeneous and illumination variation simultaneously. Meanwhile, the high-frequency attention module is designed to preserve the detailed information at the skip connections, which complements the focus on spatial features at various stages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art polyp segmentation techniques, achieving robust and superior results on five diverse datasets.

To establish the first eRNAQTL profiles for colorectal cancer (CRC) in China, epigenomic data were used to define active enhancers, which were subsequently integrated with transcription and genotyping data from 154 paired CRC samples. Finally, large-scale case-control studies (34,585 cases and 69,544 controls) were conducted along with multipronged experiments to investigate the potential mechanisms by which candidate eRNAQTLs affect CRC risk.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally; about one in every six people die suffering from it. Among many types of cancers, the lung and colon variants are the most common and deadliest ones. Together, they account for more than 25% of all cancer cases.

Cancer diagnosis can be automated by using the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which allows us to assess more cases in less time and cost.

CPT-11 is one of the first-line drugs for CRC treatment. Unfortunately, the development of drug resistance significantly exacerbates the adverse impact of CRC. Consequent tumor recurrences and metastasis, years after treatment are the frequently reported incidences. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short non-coding RNA with the functionality of gene suppression. The insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF1R) is a tyrosine kinase receptor frequently upregulated in cancers and is associated with cell survival and drug resistance. MiRNAs are frequently reported to be dysregulated in cancers including CRC. Evidence suggests that dysregulated miRNAs have direct consequences on the biological processes of their target genes. We previously demonstrated that miRNA-376a-3p is upregulated in CPT-11responsive, CRC cells upon treatment with CPT-11. We therefore aimed to investigate the involvement of miRNA-376a-3p in CPT-11 resistance and its probable association with IGF1R-mediated cancer cell survival. Our experimental approach used knockdown and overexpression experiments supplemented with western blot, RT-qPCR, flow cytometry, MTT, and migration assays to achieve our aim.

Furthermore, this study aimed to develop a prognostic model that helps clinicians establish the indication of intervention by palliative care teams. Methodology A retrospective study of patients' digital clinical history registry was conducted to meet the two core objectives. The study population was patients with solid tumors undergoing unscheduled admissions to the oncology ward between January 1, 2018, and May 31, 2018. Demographic and clinical variables of those patients were\\xa0analyzed. Specifically, the statistical analysis involved descriptive analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves, Log-Rank, and\\xa0Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection decision tree modeling. Results The results were obtained from 100 admissions of patients with an average age of 64. Of the patient cases examined, 67% (n = 67) were male.\\xa0In 72% (n = 72) of the cases, patients presented with Stage IV tumors, and the most frequent primary tumor location among the admissions was lung, at 29% (n = 29). Intervention by the palliative care team occurred for 38% (n = 38) of patients. Mortality at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days was 34% (n = 34), 56% (n = 56), 71% (n = 71), and 78% (n = 78), respectively. Hepatic metastasis was the main predictor of mortality at 30 days (65%, n = 13) and at 90 days (90%, n = 18). In the absence of hepatic metastasis, the presence of more than one symptom predicted a mortality rate of 70% at 30 days. The main factor associated with mortality at 180 and 365 days was the tumor stage, with stage IV tumors having the highest mortality rate (84.7%, n = 61, and 90.3%, n = 65, respectively). Among the Stage IV population, the primary site shows a significant impact on survival, with colorectal/reproductive tumors being associated with decreased mortality. Conclusion Unscheduled admission is a negative prognostic factor in oncologic patients. An unscheduled admission can be expected to result in low survival in an oncologic patient, especially in those presenting with stage IV; involving non-colorectal/reproductive primaries; or presenting with pain, dyspnea, cachexia, or delirium.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39335109', 'title': 'WEE1 Inhibitor Adavosertib Exerts Antitumor Effects on Colorectal Cancer, Especially in Cases with ', 'abstract': 'Inhibition of WEE1, a key regulator of the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle, induces apoptosis by initiating mitosis without repairing DNA damage.

We describe a case and aggregate results of previously published cases. We reviewed the English-language literature for all prior reports of PLR, recording age, gender, histologic diagnosis, WBC count, G-CSF level, and overall survival. We analyzed clinicopathologic variables' impact on survival. We identified 179 cases (mean age 64; 72 % M). Adeno-, squamous cell, sarcomatoid, and undifferentiated carcinomas accounted for >70 %. Esophagus, gallbladder, lung, liver, and pancreas were the most common primaries. At time of publication 81 % of patients had died, with mean overall survival of 4 months. There was no correlation between WBC count and G-CSF level. On univariate analysis, WBC count was the only variable associated with survival (P = 0.03). Patients with WBC counts >100 K/Î¼L were twice as likely to die as those with counts from 11 K to 40 K/Î¼L. PLR, typically carcinoma-associated, is characterized by dismal prognosis. The WBC count is inversely related to survival. Knowledge of this phenomenon militates against protracted, expensive work ups. In malignant neoplasms with prominent neutrophilic stroma, the pathologist should correlate with the WBC count and, if markedly elevated (>40 K/Î¼L), raise consideration for PLR.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356233', 'title': 'The Digital Divide: A Retrospective Survey of Digital Rectal Examinations during the Workup of Rectal Cancers.', 'abstract': ''}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24034143', 'title': 'Patterns of uptake in a biennial faecal occult blood test screening programme for colorectal cancer.', 'abstract': 'The patterns of response in faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening were studied.

We designed a rich multi-layered simulation containing a set of probes with true associations with either binary or continuous phenotypes, confounding by cell type, variability in means and standard deviations for population parameters, additional variability at the level of an individual cell-type-specific sample, and variability in the mixture proportions across samples. Performance varied quite substantially across methods and simulations.

Methods that filtered probes had consequently poor power. QQ plots of p values across all tested probes showed that adjustments did not always improve the distribution.

The experimental design included 156 human stool samples from healthy controls, advanced (high-risk) colorectal lesion patients (HRL), and CRC cases, with each sample sequenced using both 16S and shotgun methods. We thoroughly compared both sequencing technologies at the species, genus, and family annotation levels, the abundance differences in these taxa, sparsity, alpha and beta diversities, ability to train prediction models, and the similarity of the microbial signature derived from these models. As expected, the results showed that 16S detects only part of the gut microbiota community revealed by shotgun, although some genera were only profiled by 16S. The 16S abundance data was sparser and exhibited lower alpha diversity. In lower taxonomic ranks, shotgun and 16S highly differed, partially due to a disagreement in reference databases. When considering only shared taxa, the abundance was positively correlated between the two strategies. We also found a moderate correlation between the shotgun and 16S alpha-diversity measures, as well as their PCoAs. Regarding the machine learning models, only some of the shotgun models showed some degree of predictive power in an independent test set, but we could not demonstrate a clear superiority of one technology over the other. Microbial signatures from both sequencing techniques revealed taxa previously associated with CRC development, e.g., Parvimonas micra. Shotgun and 16S sequencing provide two different lenses to examine microbial communities. While we have demonstrated that they can unravel common patterns (including microbial signatures), shotgun often gives a more detailed snapshot than 16S, both in depth and breadth. Instead, 16S will tend to show only part of the picture, giving greater weight to dominant bacteria in a sample. Therefore, we recommend choosing one or another sequencing technique before launching a study.

The presence of cancer stem cells with chemotherapy resistance able to generate proliferating tumor cells contributes to tumor recurrence and resistance. In addition, tumor cells can develop chemoresistance through adaptation mechanisms. In this article, cancer stem cells were isolated from HT29 and SW620 colorectal cancer cell lines. Oxaliplatin resistance was induced by a single drug treatment simulating the usual guidelines of patient treatment. A comparison of these two populations showed similarities since cancer stem cells presented increased oxaliplatin resistance, and resistant cells contained an increased number of cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells isolated from resistant cells showed increased oxaliplatin resistance. Cell invasion capacity and epithelial-mesenchymal transition were increased both in cancer stem cells and oxaliplatin-resistant cells. mRNA expression analysis showed that both cell types shared a significant proportion of commonly regulated genes. In summary, the data presented indicate that colorectal cancer stem cells and oxaliplatin-resistant cells are highly related cell populations that might have interesting implications in the development of tumor recurrence and resistance to chemotherapy.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605613', 'title': 'Predictors of Metachronous Risk Polyps After Index Colonoscopy.', 'abstract': 'Guidelines for surveillance after polypectomy are lacking in strong evidence.

Data meticulously extracted from these cases were categorized and statistically analyzed. There were highly significant differences between carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and carriers of MMR gene mutations in the proportion of serous carcinomas compared with endometrioid carcinomas of the uterus, including cervix and endometium (p < 0.002), ovaries (p < 0.001) and overall, including fallopian tube and peritoneum cancers (p < 0.001). Endometrioid carcinoma was found in one and transitional carcinoma in another of the 14 BRCA1 mutation carriers with fallopian tube cancer, and endometrioid carcinoma was found in two of four MMR gene mutation carriers with fallopian tube cancers. All other fallopian tube cancers were serous carcinomas. Seven BRCA1 and one BRCA2 mutation carriers were diagnosed with primary peritoneal serous carcinoma; no peritoneal carcinomas were registered in MMR gene mutation carriers. Nine of 14 gynecologic cancers with associated endometriosis in mutation carriers were endometrioid or endometrioid mixed carcinomas compared with just three of other histologic types. Primary breast cancers, that characterize the HBOC syndrome, were much more frequent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers; while multiple gynecologic cancers and associated colorectal and urinary tract cancers, which are features of Lynch syndrome, were more common in MMR gene mutation carriers. Both serous and endometrioid carcinomas were diagnosed in MMR gene mutation carriers at significantly younger ages than in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers (p < 0.0006). These findings confirm a clear dichotomy of uterine, ovarian and fallopian tube cancers associated with inheritance of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 contrasted with inheritance of MMR gene mutations.

Understanding the shift in the geo-demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and biogenetic distribution of CRC is paramount. The Human Development Index (HDI) measuring life expectancy, education, and gross national income is a composite index comparing health outcomes between countries. This has been shown to be a useful comparison tool in measuring the health dimension among high, middle, and low-income countries. CRC has a wide global distribution in incidence and mortality with majority of cases occurring in countries with a high or very high HDI. However, in developing countries and in those undergoing rapid socioeconomic growth, there has also been a marked rise in CRC rates as well. This pattern is noted globally and seems to correlate with increase in a country's specific HDI. Additionally, another unique pattern of CRC incidence has emerged with more cancers being diagnosed in adults younger than 50 years old. Further investigation is needed to determine CRC risks reduction and implementation of primary prevention and early detection strategies within different country specific healthcare systems. Globally, improvement in healthcare equality, access to medical care and screening for CRC particularly in resource-limited (low HDI) countries is essential.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33943026', 'title': \"Hospital-level compliance with the commission on cancer's quality of care measures and the association with patient survival.\", 'abstract': \"Quality measurement has become a priority for national healthcare reform, and valid measures are necessary to discriminate hospital performance and support value-based healthcare delivery.

However, none has been formally tested as a valid metric for assessing hospital performance based on actual patient outcomes. Eligibility and compliance with the Quality of Care Measures are reported within the National Cancer Database, which also captures data for robust patient-level risk adjustment. Hospital-level compliance was calculated for the core measures, and the association with patient survival was tested using Cox regression. Seven hundred sixty-eight thousand nine hundred sixty-nine unique cancer cases were included from 1323 facilities. Increasing hospital-level compliance was associated with improved survival for only two measures, including a 35% reduced risk of mortality for the gastric cancer measure G15RLN (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.72) and a 19% reduced risk of mortality for the colon cancer measure 12RLN (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85).

We compared results for patients who had open colectomy (OS) to those with MIS operations. Subgroup analyses were performed for adjuvant chemotherapy (AC+) versus no adjuvant chemotherapy (AC-) groups and for laparoscopic (LS) versus robotic (RS) approaches. Of 7,063 patients, 4,417 cases did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (OS: 20.1%, LS: 67.1%, RS: 12.7%) and 2646 cases had adjuvant chemotherapy (OS: 28.4%, LS: 58.7%, RS: 12.9%) after discharge. MIS colectomy was associated with lower mean expenditure at index surgery and post-discharge periods for AC- patients (index surgery: $34,588 vs $36,975; 365-day post-discharge $20,051 vs $24,309) and for AC+\\u2009patients (index surgery: $37,884 vs $42,160; 365-day post-discharge $103,341vs $135,113; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 for all comparisons). LS had similar index surgery expenditures but significantly higher expenditures at post-discharge 30 days (AC-: $2,834 vs $2276, p\\u2009=\\u20090.005; AC+: $9100 vs $7698, p\\u2009=\\u20090.020) than RS. The overall complication rate was significantly lower in the MIS group than the open group for AC- patients (20.5% vs 31.2%) and AC+\\u2009patients (22.6% vs 39.1%, both p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). MIS colectomy is associated with better value at lower expenditure than open colectomy for colon cancer at the index operation and up to one year after surgery. RS expenditure is less than LS in the first 30 postoperative days regardless of chemotherapy status and may extend to 1 year for AC- patients.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35590277', 'title': 'A systematic review of methods to estimate colorectal cancer incidence using population-based cancer registries.', 'abstract': 'Epidemiological studies of incidence play an essential role in quantifying disease burden, resource planning, and informing public health policies. A variety of measures for estimating cancer incidence have been used. Appropriate reporting of incidence calculations is essential to enable clear interpretation. This review uses colorectal cancer (CRC) as an exemplar to summarize and describe variation in commonly employed incidence measures and evaluate the quality of reporting incidence methods. We searched four databases for CRC incidence studies published between January 2010 and May 2020. Two independent reviewers screened all titles and abstracts. Eligible studies were population-based cancer registry studies evaluating CRC incidence. We extracted data on study characteristics and author-defined criteria for assessing the quality of reporting incidence. We used descriptive statistics to summarize the information. This review retrieved 165 relevant articles. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) (80%) was the most commonly reported incidence measure, and the 2000 U.S. standard population the most commonly used reference population (39%). Slightly more than half (54%) of the studies reported CRC incidence stratified by anatomical site. The quality of reporting incidence methods was suboptimal. Of all included studies: 45 (27%) failed to report the classification system used to define CRC; 63 (38%) did not report CRC codes; and only 20 (12%) documented excluding certain CRC cases from the numerator. Concerning the denominator estimation: 61% of studies failed to state the source of population data; 24 (15%) indicated census years; 10 (6%) reported the method used to estimate yearly population counts; and only 5 (3%) explicitly explained the population size estimation procedure to calculate the overall average incidence rate. Thirty-three (20%) studies reported the confidence interval for incidence, and only 7 (4%) documented methods for dealing with missing data. This review identified variations in incidence calculation and inadequate reporting of methods. We outlined recommendations to optimize incidence estimation and reporting practices.

Study periods were categorized into three periods according to the major changes or advances in screening and chemotherapy regimens: (1) Period-1 (1992-1995), during which there was no evidence-based recommendation for routine CRC screening and 5-fluorouracil was the mainstay for chemotherapy; (2) Period-2 (1996-2000), during which evidences and guidelines supported the use of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and sigmoidoscopy for routine CRC screening; and (3) Period-3 (2001-2009), during which Medicare Program added the full coverage for colonoscopy screening to average-risk individuals, and several newly developed chemotherapy regimens were approved. Outcome variables included the likelihood of being diagnosed at an early stage or with a small tumor size, and improvement in relative survival. Compared to period-1, likelihood of being diagnosed with early stage CRC increased by 20% in period-2 (odds ratio = 1.2, 95%CI: 1.1-1.2) and 30% in period-3 (1.3, 1.2-1.4); and likelihood of being diagnosed with small-size CRC increased by 60% in period-2 and 110% in period-3.

To date, no passive spatial devices have been commercialized for area protection against ticks. The BiteBarrier (formerly the Personal Insect Repellent Kit, PIRK), a passive, lightweight device that emits transfluthrin, offers to fill this gap.

This study focused on three frequently used insecticides in tea cultivation: thiamethoxam, bifenthrin, and dinotefuran, aiming to investigate their dissipation behaviors and associated dietary risks upon individual and simultaneous application. The dissipation kinetics of thiamethoxam, bifenthrin, and dinotefuran were successfully characterized by first-order kinetics, yielding respective half-lives of 5.44, 9.81, and 10.16 days. Upon joint application, the dissipation half-lives of thiamethoxam and bifenthrin were notably prolonged compared with their individual applications, resulting in final concentrations after 28 days that were correspondingly elevated by 1.41 and 1.29 times. Assessment of the dietary intake risk revealed that the chronic and acute risk quotients associated with thiamethoxam and bifenthrin escalated by 1.44-1.59 times following their combined application. Although dietary risks associated with Tianmuhu white tea, as determined by the exposure assessment model, were deemed acceptable, the cumulative risks stemming from pesticide mixtures across various dietary sources warrant attention. Molecular docking analyses further unveiled that thiamethoxam and bifenthrin competitively bound to glutathione S-transferase (GST) at amino acid residues, notably at the 76th GLU and the 25th PHE, pivotal in the metabolism and absorption of exogenous substances. Moreover, the interactions between P-glycoprotein and pesticides during transport and absorption were likely to influence dissipation behaviors post-joint application.

Constitutive activation of STAT3 has been frequently observed in many cancer tissues, and thus, blocking of the gp130 signaling pathway, at the JAK level, might be a useful therapeutic approach for the suppression of STAT3 activity, as anticancer therapy. AG490 is a tyrphostin tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been extensively used for inhibiting JAK2 in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism associated with AG490 that inhibits the JAK/STAT3 pathway. AG490 induced downregulation of gp130, a common receptor for the IL-6 cytokine family compounds, but not JAK2 or STAT3, within three hours of exposure. The downregulation of gp130 was not caused by enhanced degradation of gp130 or by inhibition of mRNA transcription. It most likely occurred by translation inhibition of gp130 in association with phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor-2alpha . The inhibition of protein synthesis of gp130 by AG490 led to immediate loss of mature gp130 in cell membranes, due to its short half-life, thereby resulting in reduction in the STAT3 response to IL-6.

There are 3 widely accepted types of priapism: 1) ischaemic priapism, the commonest type seen in children; 2) stuttering priapism, recurrent, self-limiting prolonged erections; and 3) non-ischaemic priapism, rare in children, usually due to trauma. Neonatal priapism has also been described. Ischaemic priapism is a urological emergency causing fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa, subsequent erectile dysfunction and penile disfigurement. The commonest causes of priapism in children are sickle cell disease (65%), leukaemia (10%), trauma (10%), idiopathic (10%), and pharmacologically induced (5%). Priapism in children must be assessed urgently. Rapid resolution of ischaemic priapism prevents permanent cavernosal structural damage and is associated with improved prognosis for potency later in life. Stuttering priapism requires careful counselling for episodic management.

Bovine COCs were matured in vitro with inhibitors targeting lipid metabolism (etomoxir) or glucose metabolism (iodoacetate combined with dehydroepiandrosterone), in the presence or absence of FF-sEVs. Following maturation, oocytes and cumulus cells were analyzed by real-time qPCR and stained to visualize lipid droplets. The uptake of FF-sEVs was visualised by fluorescent labelling. In vitro fertilization and embryo culture were followed by mass spectrometry analysis of hatched blastocysts. We demonstrate for the first time that FF-sEVs are transported from the medium into the oocytes, via the cumulus cells and through transzonal projections (TZPs) into the perivitelline space and ooplasm. Cumulus cells under metabolic stress conditions exhibit an increased FF-sEVs uptake from the maturation medium. FF-sEVs supplementation during metabolic stress conditions enhances the MII rate in oocytes and positively affects subsequent embryo development and quality revealed by altered metabolic activity. Lipid droplet parameters and gene expression in cumulus cells and oocytes are affected by FF-sEVs supplementation, which is more pronounced in cumulus cells.

These half-light half-matter states obey Bose-Einstein statistics and have therefore promised a route toward room temperature condensates and low-threshold polariton lasers. However, our understanding of how to enhance the rate of relaxation toward the lowest energy excited state must be greatly enhanced for electrically driven organic condensates and polariton lasers to be realized. Here, the mechanism of excited-state relaxation in colloidal plexcitonic materials (CPMs) is explored. CPMs are a subgroup of polaritonic materials formed when an exciton interacts strongly with a plasmonic resonance of a nanoparticle. Based on our current understanding of relaxation in polaritonic systems, which is based on experiments done using Fabry-PÃ©rot cavities, CPMs are expected to have high relaxation rates through the vibrationally assisted scattering (VAS) mechanism. However, so far, it has been unclear whether we can transfer the knowledge gained from Fabry-PÃ©rot cavities to plasmonic cavities. Our results indicate that not only VAS but also surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is active in CPMs and that the predominant mechanism depends on to which state excitation occurs. Therefore, caution must be exercised when interpreting the emission from plexcitonic materials and when using theories obtained from polaritonic materials prepared with Fabry-PÃ©rot cavities on plexcitonic materials. Additionally, we found that plexcitonic materials can provide an electromagnetic enhancement of both the excitation and emission part in SERS, increasing its enhancement factor and allowing tuning of the sensitivity to specific vibrations.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40114826', 'title': 'Super-high levels of serum intact-parathyroid hormone and bone turnover markers descended with recuperating allograft function and a short-term high-dose methylprednisolone during preoperative period of renal transplantation: a retrospective cohort study.', 'abstract': 'Secondary hyperparathyroidism is an important factor of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), which frequently results in maintenance dialysis patients having super-high levels of serum intact-parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and bone turnover markers (BTMs).

The translated questionnaire was piloted with five psychiatric users and further revised. The revised content was back-translated by a professional translator and checked by the original author. An online questionnaire was administered to verify the validity and reliability of the completed Japanese PSAS. The questionnaire was distributed to individuals who received mental health services on a mailing list. Some respondents were asked to complete the questionnaire a second time to examine the reliability of the retest method. Reliability was examined by calculating Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the entire scale and subscales and evaluating the results of the correlation coefficients with the retest. For validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted, and correlation coefficients were calculated using related scales (the Japanese versions of the Desirability of Control, Desire for Autonomy, and Health Locus of Control scales).Results\\u3000The questionnaire received 214 responses, and the test-retest questionnaire received 48 responses. Most respondents had been diagnosed with mood disorders (48.1%) or schizophrenia (40.7%), and 46.8% had been receiving psychiatric care for > 10 years. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the overall scale and subscale analyses and correlation coefficients for retests ranged from 0.66-0.83 and 0.69-0.84, respectively. Regarding validity, exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors with items similar to those in the original version, and confirmatory factor analysis showed goodness of fit (CMIN/DF = 2.834, GFI = 0.896, AGFI = 0.841, RMSEA = 0.093, AIC = 198.542, CFI = 0.888).

This study focuses on exploring the mechanisms underlying this effect. SMase increased the abundance of dihydroceramides, a result mimicked by blockade of ceramidase enzyme using ceranib-1, which also decreased CFTR function. The SMase-mediated inhibitory mechanism did not involve the reduction of cellular CFTR abundance or removal of CFTR from the apical surface, nor did it involve the activation of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase. In order to determine the pathological relevance of these sphingolipid imbalances, we evaluated the sphingolipid profiles of cfHBEs and cfHNEs (nasal) as compared to non-CF controls.

For both drugs, the peak plasma concentration was lower and the half-life was shorter than the known values in adults. The blood trough level of bosentan significantly correlated with its dose, but no such correlation was seen for tadalafil. For both drugs, no correlation was observed between age and blood drug levels. Oral dosing with bosentan and tadalafil in children may not achieve therapeutic blood concentration.

However, in many cases, blockade of CD47 by itself is insufficient to activate macrophage effectively, indicating other unidentified phagocytosis-regulating factors to resist the macrophage activity. In this study, a genome-wide human CRISPR-Cas9 library was developed for comprehensive screening of phagocytosis-regulating factors in the context of CD47 blockade. The screening results identified GSTK1 as a potential anti-phagocytic signal counteracting the efficacy of CD47-based phagocytosis. The disruption of GSTK1 significantly increased the phagocytosis rate of cancer cells by macrophages in combination with anti-CD47 antibody. Further mechanism investigation unveiled that GSTK1 blockade increased the membrane exposure of calreticulin in different cancer cells, which might be the primary mechanism driving enhanced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis. To this end, siGSTK1-loaded nanoparticles (siGSTK1-LNPs) were designed to suppress the GSTK1 expression efficiently. The comparable phagocytosis efficacy was also observed when combining siGSTK1-LNPs with anti-CD47 antibody.

This study investigates the role of serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in mediating MDR during chemotherapeutic exposure. The findings indicate that short- or long-term co-incubation of doxorubicin (Dox)-pretreated serum derived EVs (EVs(S-PT)) caused drug-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells to develop a MDR phenotype. In addition, serum EVs contain a high concentration of unglycosylated P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Chemotherapy treatment of tumor patients or exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro activates serum glycosyltransferases, inducing glycosylation of EVs P-gp and giving it drug-pumping activity. Furthermore, damage caused by Dox to the vascular endothelial barrier facilitates the crossing of serum EVs into the tumor microenvironment. These EVs are then taken up by tumor cells, providing them with access to a significant quantity of glycosylated P-gp proteins that possess transporter activity and the ability to evade degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system. The results indicate that EVs(S-PT) transfers glycosylated P-gp across the damaged vascular endothelial barrier into MCF-7 cells and that these glycosylated P-gp remain intracellular for a long period of time, inducing MDR in the cells.

Our previous research showed that lenvatinib can inhibit GPX2 expression and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related cell apoptosis in HCC. The present study intends to explore whether lenvatinib can induce ICD and clarify its underlying mechanisms in HCC. Flow cytometry was utilized to detect the expression levels of CRT and CD markers, measure intracellular ROS levels, and assess cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was employed to determine changes in protein levels, while qRT-PCR analysis was used to quantify alterations in mRNA levels. Subcutaneous allograft tumor models were established to investigate the mechanism of lenvatinib against HCC. Immunohistochemical (IF) staining were used to detect the ratio of CD8 Herein, we found that HCC cells treated with lenvatinib or si-GPX2 showed increased ICD markers, such as CRT exposure, ATP secretion, and HMGB1 release. Notably, we demonstrated that lenvatinib promoted dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and CD8+\\u2009T cells activation, thus inducing HCC cell apoptosis when co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, we further demonstrated that lenvatinib or GPX2 inhibition triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in HCC cells, which is mediated by the accumulation of ROS. Our findings indicate that pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine suppressed lenvatinib-induced expression of CRT on the cell membrane, ATP secretion and HMGB1 release, and inhibited lenvatinib-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we also found that ERS inhibitor ISRIB could reverse lenvatinib-induced upregulation of ICD biomarkers. Moreover, we further identified that downregulation of GPX2 enhanced the efficacy of lenvatinib via triggering ERS-mediated ICD in HCC. This study uncovered that lenvatinib could be a potent ICD inducer, which could trigger ERS via increasing ROS levels in HCC cells, which present valuable insights into the mechanism of lenvatinib-induced ICD in HCC cells.

However, the characteristics and patterns of physical-mental multimorbidity based on the diagnosis of mental disorders in Chinese adults remain unclear. A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2004 to April 2005 among 13,358 adults (ages 18-65years) residing in Liaoning Province, China, to evaluate the occurrence of physical-mental multimorbidity. Mental disorders were assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (version 1.0) with reference to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd Edition Revised), while physical diseases were self-reported. Physical-mental multimorbidity was assessed based on a list of 16 physical and mental morbidities with prevalence â¥1% and was defined as the presence of one mental disorder and one physical disease. The chi-square test was used to calculate differences in the prevalence and comorbidity of different diseases between the sexes. A matrix heat map was generated of the absolute number of comorbidities for each disease. To identify complex associations and potential disease clustering patterns, a network analysis was performed, constructing a network to explore the relationships within and between various mental disorders and physical diseases. Physical-mental multimorbidity was confirmed in 3.7% (498) of the participants, with a higher prevalence among women (4.2%, 282) than men (3.3%, 216). The top three diseases with the highest comorbidity rate and average number of comorbidities were dysphoric mood (86.3%; 2.86), social anxiety disorder (77.8%; 2.78) and major depressive disorder (77.1%; 2.53). A physical-mental multimorbidity network was visually divided into mental and physical domains. Additionally, four distinct multimorbidity patterns were identified: 'Affective-addiction', 'Anxiety', 'Cardiometabolic' and 'Gastro-musculoskeletal-respiratory', with the digestive-respiratory-musculoskeletal pattern being the most common among the total sample. The affective-addiction pattern was more prevalent in men and rural populations. The cardiometabolic pattern was more common in urban populations. The physical-mental multimorbidity network structure and the four patterns identified in this study align with previous research, though we observed notable differences in the proportion of these patterns. These variations highlight the importance of tailored interventions that address specific multimorbidity patterns while maintaining broader applicability to diverse populations.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37642363', 'title': 'Uncovering oligodendrocyte enhancers that control Cnp expression.', 'abstract': \"Oligodendrocytes (OLs) produce myelin sheaths around axons in the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin accelerates the propagation of action potentials along axons and supports the integrity of axons. Impaired myelination has been linked to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. As a major component of CNS myelin, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) plays an indispensable role in the axon-supportive function of myelin. Notably, this function requires a high-level expression of CNP in OLs, as evidenced by downregulated expression of CNP in mental disorders and animal models. Little is known about how CNP expression is regulated in OLs. Especially, OL enhancers that govern CNP remain elusive. We have recently developed a powerful method that links OL enhancers to target genes in a principled manner. Here, we applied it to Cnp, uncovering two OL enhancers for it (termed Cnp-E1 and Cnp-E2). Epigenome editing analysis revealed that Cnp-E1 and Cnp-E2 are dedicated to Cnp. ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data show that Cnp-E1 and Cnp-E2 are conserved OL-specific enhancers.

In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics.

This study aimed to develop a screening tool that measures daily activities promoting physical activity among older adults and assessed its content and face validity. In Stage 1, we derived constructs pertinent to physical activity from previous literature and formulated an item list based on a prior qualitative study we undertook in Japan that evaluated daily behaviours facilitating physical activity among older adults. During Stage 2, we assessed the content and face validity of the list utilising the Nominal Group Technique (NGT), involving eight experts. The content validity was confirmed through two scoring evaluation rounds, while the face validity was verified through the NGT discussion, focusing on the comprehensibility and appropriateness of the tool. We created a tool with 22 items consisting of three constructs. The NGT participants modified eight of these items for the final assessment, resulting in a finalised tool comprising 22 items that satisfied the adaptation criteria.

However, whether this mechanism acts as a global neural code for memory retention across sensory modalities remains to be demonstrated. Intracranial EEG data were recorded while drug-resistant patients with epilepsy performed a delayed matched-to-sample task with tone sequences. We manipulated task difficulty by varying the memory load and the duration of the silent retention period between the to-be-compared sequences. We show that the strength of theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling in the superior temporal sulcus, the inferior frontal gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, and the hippocampus (i) supports the short-term retention of auditory sequences; (ii) decodes correct and incorrect memory trials as revealed by machine learning analysis; and (iii) is positively correlated with individual short-term memory performance. Specifically, we show that successful task performance is associated with consistent phase coupling in these regions across participants, with gamma bursts restricted to specific theta phase ranges corresponding to higher levels of neural excitability. These findings highlight the role of cortico-hippocampal activity in auditory short-term memory and expand our knowledge about the role of cross-frequency coupling as a global biological mechanism for information processing, integration, and memory in the human brain.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30674275', 'title': 'Superior mesenteric artery syndrome coexists with Nutcracker syndrome in a female: a case report.', 'abstract': \"Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome, also known as Wilkie's syndrome or Benign duodenal stasis, is a rare benign disease.

The aim is to understand how the twinning rate evolved in conjunction with the processes of economic and social modernization, as well as the demographic transition. During the period analyzed, the twinning rate increased by 10%, rising from 1.26 per 1000 births in the second half of the 18th century to 1.38 per 1000 births in the first half of the 20th century. This rate varied due to hereditary issues, biological factors such as the mother's age and parity, and socioeconomic features like family occupation and the mother's education level. In terms of child mortality, twins historically faced a significantly higher mortality rate. However, they benefited greatly from the mortality transition, at least in absolute numbers. While nearly 60% of twins did not survive beyond 5 years of age in earlier periods, the mortality rate for twins decreased to 40% by the first half of the 20th century. The excess mortality was particularly severe for girls, driven by a widespread preference for sons, which led to higher mortality rates for girls in the first 5 years of life, especially in the earliest months. These findings help us understand the improvements in uterine and childhood survival rates for contemporary twins, which can be attributed to the socioeconomic and medical advancements of the 20th century.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38363902', 'title': 'Informing the development of the SUCCEED reporting guideline for studies on the scaling of health interventions: A systematic review.', 'abstract': 'Quality reporting contributes to effective translation of health research in practice and policy.

However, little information is available in relation to internet use among caregivers in general, especially those caring for people with dementia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dementia-related internet use and factors that may be associated with its use among caregivers of people with dementia in Greece. Secondary data from the Greek Dementia Survey of the Athens Association of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders were collected from April to June 2017. A total of 580 caregivers of people with dementia participated in the study. The majority of the caregivers reported that they had used the internet in the previous 3 months (84.1%, 488/580). Nearly half of the caregivers (47.5%, 276/580) reported that they had received dementia services online. Bivariate analysis showed that a dementia-specific search of information was associated with age, education, kinship, and years of care. Age (odds ratio [OR] 2.362, 95% CI 1.05-5.33) and education (OR 2.228, 95% CI 1.01-4.94) were confirmed as predictors, with younger caregivers and those with higher educational attainment being more likely to search for dementia-specific information. Use of the internet to search for dementia information was only related to hours of care. The internet use by caregivers within the previous 3 months was associated with variables such as age, education, occupation, kinship, years of care, and self-reported impact on physical and social health. Caregivers of people with dementia in Greece, as in the other southern European countries, are essential agents of the national health system. The existing short- and long-term respite care services are limited or nonexistent. Currently, caregivers receive mostly support and education from memory clinics and municipality consultation centers, which are mainly based in central cities in Greece. Despite the dementia awareness movement in Greece, there is still space to integrate the role of technology in the support and education of caregivers. Development of training programs for enhancing electronic health literacy skills as well as web-based services provision could support Greek caregivers in their everyday caring tasks.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40242597', 'title': 'Excessive activation?induced cytidine deaminase accumulated by proteasome inhibitors rescues abnormal class switch in activated B?cell?like diffuse large B?cell lymphoma.', 'abstract': 'Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in mediating somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination (CSR).

No criteria guide which patients to refer to EDDC for appointment-making. Patients screening positive for SDoH are texted or emailed a list of community-based organizations (CBOs) to contact; the screening tool doesn\\'t assess patients\\' interest or ability to contact CBOs. Additionally, our ED\\'s clinical and operational administrators run a follow-up call program for discharged patients to inquire about their recovery. This program is associated with improved patient satisfaction, a strategic initiative tied to reimbursement. Owing to high volume,\\xa0only 8.6% (4,877 of 56,591) of discharged patients are called. We describe an application of Learning Organization principles and practices to evaluate EDDC efficiency and identify opportunities to create time for EDDC staff to participate in and expand the follow-up call program. Methods A \"Learning Organization\" follows five principles (systems thinking, personal mastery, mental models, shared vision, and team learning) to facilitate its members\\' learning and continuously transform itself. To evaluate EDDC processes (\"systems thinking\"), the overriding Learning Organization principle we adopted was \"integrate learning into the business process.\" We established \"team learning\" by engaging EDDC staff and ED leadership (\"leadership commitment\"), thereby \"promoting ownership at every level.\" We shadowed EDDC staff and analyzed data for 3,616 patients receiving appointment assistance, 342 offered SDoH screening, and 4,877 called by phone. We identified the validated SHOUT tool (which predicts discharge failure) and its highly weighted criteria (no home, insurance, or primary care physician). We randomly surveyed 50 patients to determine: 1) what percent met those highly-weighted criteria, with the idea being to guide providers about which patients particularly benefit from EDDC assistance, and 2) what percent had not only SDoH social service needs but also interest and ability to contact CBOs, as this would be their responsibility. Adopting these two changes (SHOUT tool and assessing interest/ability to contact CBOs) might yield more judicious utilization of EDDC personnel, freeing up time to staff the follow-up call program. Results EDDC staff spend ~35 minutes/patient. They don\\'t make appointments but instead liaise with physicians\\' offices, which yields fewer ED returns and admissions. Only 6% (3\\xa0of 50) of surveyed patients met SHOUT criteria for EDDC assistance. Of 342 patients screened for SDoH, 31% (106) completed the survey, 20% (68) identified a need, and only 4.5% (15) completed it, identified a need, and followed up on their own after receiving CBO names and contact information. Only 50% of call-back patients were contactable: 77% had improved, 21% were unchanged; ~50% had made appointments without EDDC assistance; and 12.5% had clinical questions. Conclusion Learning Organization exercises identified the SHOUT tool and revealed the potential for SHOUT criteria and QR-code-accessible two-step SDoH surveys to create significant time for EDDC to staff follow-up program expansion. Thousands more patients would be screened for SDoH, saving 95% of the effort while retaining 100% of the benefit. EDDC staff would serve as a safety net for follow-up calls for patients unable to secure an appointment.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35352868', 'title': 'Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in pregnancy: Systematic review and meta-analysis of maternal and perinatal safety and clinical outcomes.', 'abstract': 'The efficacy and safety profile of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5i) in pregnancy are unclear from the few relatively small diverse studies that have used them.

Subsequently, we performed quantitative global proteomics of SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells at the time of virus entry and during peak viral infection and compared proteomic changes with uninfected control. Subsequently, we implemented pathway enrichment of differentially regulated host proteins and identified regulated cellular pathways during different stages of infection. Finally, we investigated the role of selected proteins identified as significantly regulated through proteome analysis along with some of those proteins previously reported to be involved in any mode of endocytosis, in the raft-dependent endocytosis using inhibitor assay and further validated their role in viral entry through loss-of-function assays. Our results confirm that enveloped viruses exploit the raft-dependent endocytosis as a major route for host cell entry. We further report novel host cell proteins that participate as mediators of raft-dependent endocytosis.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40270062', 'title': 'Diagnostic utility of ultrasonography in the management of postoperative fluid collections\\xa0and abdominal indwelling catheters following pancreaticoduodenectomy: retrospective cohort study.', 'abstract': 'The management of postoperative fluid collections, which refers to the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity following pancreaticoduodenectomy, presents significant challenges. However, ultrasonography has emerged as a promising tool for diagnosing and guiding interventions for this condition. Ultrasonography offers several advantages, including accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and real-time imaging capabilities. It plays a crucial role in identifying ascitic fluid collections, characterizing their contents, and evaluating the severity of fluid collections. Moreover, ultrasound guidance enhances the safety and effectiveness of placing abdominal catheters. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic utility of ultrasonography in postoperative fluid collections following pancreaticoduodenectomy and evaluate the clinical efficacy of ultrasound-guided abdominal catheter placement. A total of 309 hospitalized patients underwent postoperative pancreaticoduodenectomy, with 171 patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) and 138 patients undergoing open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD), as assessed by ultrasonography. We examined the abdominal cavity for the presence of postoperative fluid collections and evaluated the site of postoperative fluid collections and the necessity for tube drainage. In cases where an abdominal indwelling catheter was required, we observed the location of postoperative fluid collections, performed echocardiography, and analyzed the characteristics of drainage fluid. We conducted a comparative analysis of short-term postoperative outcomes between LPD and OPD, encompassing hospitalization duration, fever duration, presence or localization of postoperative fluid collections, number of abdominal indwelling catheters used, location of abdominal drainage fluid collection, and time until postoperative catheter removal. The LPD group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of postoperative fluid collections compared to the OPD group, as determined by ultrasonography (39.2% vs. 59.3%, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). Additionally, the LPD group had shorter hospital stays (16 [13, 21] vs. 21 [17, 28] days; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), reduced duration of fever (1 [0, 3] vs. 3 [1, 5] days; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), faster time to postoperative catheterization (7 [5, 10] vs. 8 [6, 13] days; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), fewer required tubes (0 [0, 1] vs. 1 [0, 1]; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and shorter extubation time (7 [5, 9] vs. 9 [5, 12] h; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) compared to the OPD group. There were correlations observed between the two groups regarding postoperative fluid collections, ultrasound sound transmission, separation of postoperative fluid collections, and traits of drainage fluid. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of postoperative fluid collections location (dissociative or restrictive), ultrasound sound transmission (excellent or poor), and separation of postoperative fluid collections (no separation, less separation, and more separation). Postoperative fluid collections is a commonly encountered concurrent condition following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Ultrasonography allows for the observation of diverse characteristics related to postoperative fluid collections, including its precise localization, sound transmission properties, and the presence of internal separations. Moreover, it enables timely guidance for precise placement of drainage tubes.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39988928', 'title': 'Fifty years of free tissue transfer: the past, present and future of microsurgical reconstruction.', 'abstract': 'G.

However, GLP-1's very short half-life, arising from cleavage by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) and glomerular filtration by the kidneys, presented challenges for clinical use.

Three categories of GLP-1 analogs, are being developed and/or are in clinical use: short-acting, long-acting, and prolonged-acting GLP-1 analogs.

The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that infusion of rolipram into the nucleus accumbens would decrease cocaine-induced enhancement of the sensitivity of brain stimulation reward (BSR) pathways. BSR thresholds were determined in rats after the systemic administration of cocaine (4 mg/kg IP) and the infusion of rolipram (0.2 microg/side) into the nucleus accumbens both alone and in combination. Thresholds also were determined after the systemic administration of rolipram alone and, as a positive control, for amphetamine (10 microg/side) infused into the nucleus accumbens. BSR thresholds were significantly lowered below baseline levels following d-amphetamine administration suggesting that cannulae were in place to allow perfusion of reward pathways. Compared to values for saline alone, thresholds were lower after the injection of cocaine (4 mg/kg IP) or the infusion of rolipram (0.2 microg/side) into the nucleus accumbens. Treatment with the combination of cocaine and intra-nucleus accumbens rolipram produced a greater lowering of the BSR threshold than did administration of either rolipram or cocaine alone. Systemic administration of rolipram (0.5 mg/kg IP) either blocked the effects of BSR or raised BSR thresholds and produced stimulation-induced head jerking in most of the test animals. These results suggest that infusion into the nucleus accumbens of rolipram, an agent that putatively elevates cAMP levels in this structure, can enhance the sensitivity of reward pathways to BSR and can augment cocaine's actions on these pathways.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39317550', 'title': 'Patient care for burn victims in Brazil: A national survey.', 'abstract': 'To analyze, through the responses of physicians who work in burn treatment units, their demographic profiles and academic backgrounds, the structure available for patient care, the adoption of care protocols, support from medical and multidisciplinary specialties, and the main challenges faced by these professionals.

During Ramadan, 39.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.6%-42.6%) reported decreased physical activity, and 56.6% (95% CI; 53.0%-60.2%) stated having self-reported good sleep. The independent correlates of physical activity were female sex (adjusted odds ratio (aOR):0.5, 95% CI: 0.4-0.8), having very good sleep (aOR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.7), and obesity (aOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.7). In addition, factors associated with improved self-reported sleep quality were perceived good health state (aOR: 8.8, 95% CI: 1.1-72.4), sleeping 7-9 h per day (aOR: 5.5, 95% CI: 2.6-10.3), and sleeping for over 9 h per day (aOR: 4.6, 95% CI: 2.1-14.1). Although physical activity decreased by about a third, over half of the respondents lost weight and slept well during Ramadan.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) of arterial origin recognizes endothelial dysfunction as one of its main determinants and shares risk factors and physiopathological evolution with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Tadalafil, selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase V, long half-life, is used to treat erectile dysfunction, and several studies have already documented the beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the concentrations of EPCs and EMPs in patients with arterial ED and MetS, before and after tadalafil administration, and in healthy men. Thirty patients (47-54 years) with ED and MetS (ATP III 1999 criteria) and 17 healthy men (44-57 years) were selected. EPCs (CD45neg/CD34pos/CD144pos) and EMPs (CD45neg/CD34neg/CD144pos) blood concentrations were evaluated by flow cytometry before and after administration of tadalafil (20 mg) on demand for 3 months. After treatment, the patients were divided into responders and poor responders, according to their IIEF-5 score. Blood EPCs and EMPs. Before treatment, the percentage of EPCs and EMPs was significantly higher in patients with ED and MetS compared to healthy men. Treatment with tadalafil increased significantly EPCs in both responders and poor responders. The latter had significantly higher EPCs compared to responders, both before and after tadalafil. Before tadalafil, EMPs were higher, but not significantly, in poor responders vs. responders. No significant change occurred after tadalafil administration in both responders and poor responders. A significant positive correlation was found between EPCs and age, Body Mass Index (BMI), acceleration time, IMT and EDV; whereas a negative correlation was found with IIEF-5 score, PSV and resistance index. EMPs correlated positively with BMI, acceleration time and IMT and negatively with the IIEF-5 score. Tadalafil increased the percentage of EPCs in both responders and poor responders, suggesting the persistence of an adequate bone marrow response. The unchanged EMP concentrations after tadalafil suggest a reduction of the dysfunctional mechanism.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40083897', 'title': 'Therapeutics of acute myeloid leukemia with central nervous system involvement.', 'abstract': ''}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40139383', 'title': 'Inheritance of bovine lymphocyte intestinal retention defect disorder affects Holstein production performance and longevity.', 'abstract': \"Improved methods previously developed for tracking new mutations within existing haplotypes for cholesterol deficiency (HCD) and muscle weakness (HMW) now also were applied to track the bovine lymphocyte intestinal retention defect (BLIRD) discovered in France.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of theophylline added to SNI compared with placebo for COVID-19-related OD. This triple-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 randomized clinical trial was conducted virtually between March 15 and August 31, 2021. Adults residing in Missouri or Illinois were recruited during this time period if they had OD persisting for 3 to 12 months following suspected COVID-19 infection. Data analysis was conducted from October to December 2021. Saline sinus rinse kits and bottles of identical-appearing capsules with either 400 mg of theophylline (treatment) or 500 mg of lactose powder (control) were mailed to consenting study participants. Participants were instructed to dissolve the capsule contents into the saline rinse and use the solution to irrigate their nasal cavities in the morning and at night for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was the difference in the rate of responders between the treatment and the control arms, defined as a response of at least slightly better improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale posttreatment. Secondary outcome measures included changes in the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT), the Questionnaire for Olfactory Disorders, the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey on general health, and COVID-19-related questions. A total of 51 participants were enrolled in the study; the mean (SD) age was 46.0 (13.1) years, and 36 (71%) participants were women. Participants were randomized to SNI with theophylline (n\\u2009=\\u200926) or to SNI with placebo (n\\u2009=\\u200925). Forty-five participants completed the study. At the end of treatment, 13 (59%) participants in the theophylline arm reported at least slight improvement in the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (responders) compared with 10 (43%) in the placebo arm (absolute difference, 15.6%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 44.5%). The median difference for the UPSIT change between baseline and 6 weeks was 3.0 (95% CI, -1.0 to 7.0) for participants in the theophylline arm and 0.0 (95% CI, -2.0 to 6.0) for participants in the placebo arm. Mixed-model analysis revealed that the change in UPSIT scores through study assessments was not statistically significantly different between the 2 study arms. Eleven (50%) participants in the theophylline arm and 6 (26%) in the placebo arm had a change of 4 or more points in UPSIT scores from baseline to 6 weeks. The difference in the rate of responders as measured by the UPSIT was 24% (95% CI, -4% to 52%) in favor of theophylline. This randomized clinical trial suggests that the clinical benefit of theophylline nasal irrigations on olfaction in participants with COVID-19-related OD is inconclusive, though suggested by subjective assessments.

This practice is a prominent source of indoor air pollution and has been linked to the development of a variety of cardiopulmonary diseases, including Tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between current biomass smoke exposure and self-reported quality of life scores in a cohort of previous TB patients in Uganda. We reviewed medical records from six TB clinics from 9/2019-9/2020 and conducted phone interviews to obtain information about biomass smoke exposure. A random sample of these patients were asked to complete three validated quality-of-life surveys including the St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), the EuroQol 5 Dimension 3 Level system (EQ-5D-3L) which includes the EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS), and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). The cohort was divided up into 3 levels based on years of smoke exposure-no-reported smoke exposure (0 years), light exposure (1-19 years), and heavy exposure (20+ years), and independent-samples-Kruskal-Wallis testing was performed with post-hoc pairwise comparison and the Bonferroni correction. The results of this testing indicated significant increases in survey scores for patients with current biomass exposure and a heavy smoke exposure history (20+ years) compared to no reported smoke exposure in the SGRQ activity scores (adj. p = 0.018) and EQ-5D-3L usual activity scores (adj. p = 0.002), indicating worse activity related symptoms. There was a decrease in EQ-VAS scores for heavy (adj. p = 0.007) and light (adj. p = 0.017) exposure groups compared to no reported exposure, indicating lower perceptions of overall health. These results may suggest worse outcomes or baseline health for TB patients exposed to biomass smoke at the time of treatment and recovery, however further research is needed to characterize the effect of indoor air pollution on TB treatment outcomes.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40234231', 'title': 'Spontaneous Gallbladder Perforation in a Patient With Osteogenesis Imperfecta Type III: A Rare Case Report.', 'abstract': 'Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is an inherited connective tissue disorder (CTD) characterized by recurrent fractures, low bone mass, skeletal deformity, and variable short stature.

This case highlights the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for spontaneous ischemic GBP in patients with CTDs such as OI Type III. A 20-year-old woman with severe OI type III presented to the emergency department with a two-day history of abdominal pain and distension. Abdominal computed tomography revealed free intraperitoneal air anterior to the liver and adjacent to the falciform ligament, which was suggestive of GBP. No gallstones or sludge were identified within the gallbladder lumen. An emergent open cholecystectomy was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed a concealed perforation at the gallbladder fundus. Due to dense adhesions and the inability to achieve the critical view of safety, a partial cholecystectomy was performed to reduce the risk of biliary and vascular injury.

Ce6-GFFY forms macroparticles with a diameter of â¼160\\xa0nm and possesses a half-life of 10\\xa0h, as well as an ideal tumor-targeting ability in mouse models. Ce6-GFFY effectively penetrates cells and generates numerous reactive oxygen species upon 660\\xa0nm laser irradiation. The reactive oxygen species promotes the accumulation of cytotoxic T cells and decrease of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment through immunogenic cell death, thus prohibiting the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors after once treatment. This study not only provides a strategy for photosensitizer development but also confirms a promising application of Ce6-GFFY for colorectal cancer therapy.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23540436', 'title': 'A 6-month, prospective, observational study of PDE5 inhibitor treatment persistence and adherence in Middle Eastern and North African men with erectile dysfunction.', 'abstract': \"Erectile dysfunction (ED) negatively impacts quality of life.

Enrolled men were â¥18 years old from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, PDE5I naÃ¯ve, and sexually active. PDE5Is were selected per routine clinical practice. Persistence was defined as use of â¥1 dose during the prior 4 weeks, adherence as compliance with dosing instructions during the most recent dose. Logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with persistence and adherence. Persistence and Adherence Questionnaire; Partner Relationship Questionnaire; Self-Esteem and Relationship Questionnaire; International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF); Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction. Patients' (n = 493) mean age was 49.8 years, mean BMI was 29.3, and the majority (n = 354, 71.8%) were from Saudi Arabia. Tadalafil was the most prescribed PDE5I (69.6%), versus sildenafil (15.4%), or vardenafil (15.0%). Patients' mean IIEF-Erectile Function scores improved from moderate to mild and Erection Hardness Scores (SD) improved from 1.8 (1.0) at baseline to 3.5 (0.7) at 6 months. At 6 months, 64.9% of patients were treatment persistent (tadalafil, 68.8%, sildenafil, 65.8%, and vardenafil, 45.9%) and 59.6% were adherent. Factors significantly predictive (p < 0.05) of persistence at 6 months included age, employment status, and ED severity. Factors significantly predictive of adherence were age, employment status, and duration of ED. Interpretation of differences between drugs was limited by substantial differences in prescription rates between countries. At 6 months, 64.9% of men were treatment persistent. In this study, age, employment status, ED severity, and duration of ED were associated with persistence and/or adherence.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40207772', 'title': 'TAK-003: development of a tetravalent dengue vaccine.', 'abstract': 'Dengue incidence has increased over the past few decades.

We hypothesized that there is discordance between physicians' and patients' views of SLE flare. In this study, we aimed to explore patient and physician descriptions of SLE flares. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using in-depth interviews with a purposeful sample of patients with SLE (who met 1997 American College of Rheumatology or Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics criteria) and practicing rheumatologists. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using applied thematic analysis. Forty-two patient participants with SLE, representing a range of SLE activity, completed interviews. The majority described flare symptoms as joint pain, fatigue, and skin issues lasting several days. Few included objective signs or laboratory measures, when available, as features of flare. We interviewed 13 rheumatologists from 10 academic and 3 community settings. The majority defined flare as increased or worsening SLE disease activity, with slightly more than half requiring objective findings. Around half of the rheumatologists included fatigue, pain, or other patient-reported symptoms. Patients and physicians described flare differently. Participants with SLE perceived flares as several days of fatigue, pain, and skin issues. Providers defined flares as periods of increased clinical SLE activity. Our findings suggest the current definition of flare may be insufficient to integrate both perceptions. Further study is needed to understand the pathophysiology of patient flares and the best way to incorporate patients' perspectives into clinical assessments.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40182499', 'title': 'Crystal structure and polymorphic forms of auranofin revisited.', 'abstract': 'Auranofin, initially developed as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, is currently under extensive investigation as a potential drug for various conditions, including cancer, bacterial infections, and parasitic infections. The compound is a known inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD1) and related selenoproteins. Although preliminary studies on the auranofin crystal polymorphism exist, and a low-quality crystal structure has been reported, a comprehensive crystallographic characterization remains unexplored. Utilizing X-ray crystallography techniques, we conducted detailed structural analysis of auranofin and compared our findings with related organogold compounds. Implementation of Hirshfeld atom refinement (HAR) enabled a more accurate hydrogen atom positioning in the structure. The crystal packing reveals a layered arrangement stabilised by numerous weak hydrogen bonds and dispersive interactions. Notably, our attempts to reproduce the previously reported polymorphic form of auranofin, purportedly more water-soluble, were unsuccessful despite following published protocols. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing a \"disappearing polymorph\" phenomenon of any pharmaceutically relevant transition metal coordination compound. Our findings may have significant implications for medicinal chemistry and pharmacology of coordination complexes, suggesting the need for systematic revision of historical crystallographic data in this field.'}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40293180', 'title': 'Zongertinib in Previously Treated ', 'abstract': 'Innovative oral targeted therapies are warranted for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( We evaluated zongertinib in a multicohort, phase 1a-1b trial involving patients with advanced or metastatic  In cohort 1, a total of 75 patients received zongertinib at a dose of 120 mg.

Mitochondrial damage and immune disorders are direct factors, which exacerbate the occurrence and progression of AP. So far, mitochondrial and immunity injury in SAP remains largely elusive, with no established treatment options available. Immunomodulation is a promising approach to treat pancreatitis. Herein, we proved that Tuftsin (TN), a vital endogenous immunomodulator, can inhibit SAP, while it is limited by extremely short biological half-life, low bioavailability, and the inconvenience of administration. Nano platform is the positive choice. Interestingly, we found that the activated P2X7 signaling was closely associated with the enhanced pancreatic inflammation via damaging mitochondrial function in SAP. Herein, we engineered a nanoplatform containing a Se-Se bond responsive for ROS to deliver TN, namely, DSPE-Se-Se-MPEG@TN (DSSM@TN), contributing to increases in TN's half-life and bioavailability. We synthesized TN-loaded ROS-responsive DSPE-Se-Se- MPEG@TN liposomes (DSSM@TN NPs) via a one-step emulsification method, which exhibited good biosecurity, high stability, suitable size, favorable ROS responsiveness and biocompatibility, as well as excellent capability for releasing TN during oxidative stress and inflammation environment. Moreover, the Se-Se bond with ROS-responsive ability was first proved to play a vital role for TN-loaded liposomes to enhance its anti-inflammation and antioxidant abilities via targeting damaged mitochondria during SAP progression. Mechanistically, DSSM@TN targeting damaged pancreas simultaneously inhibits mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in vivo and vitro via mitochondrial P2X7 signaling-impaired Nrf2/HO-1 signaling-inhibited PINK1/PARKIN pathway. Consequently, such a ROS-responsive immunotherapy nanomedicine targeted mitochondria holds great potential in facilitating substantial clinical progress in SAP treatment.\"}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28892517', 'title': 'Naturally acquired antibody responses to more than 300 Plasmodium vivax proteins in three geographic regions.', 'abstract': 'Plasmodium vivax remains an important cause of malaria in South America and the Asia-Pacific. Naturally acquired antibody responses against multiple P. vivax proteins have been described in numerous countries, however, direct comparison of these responses has been difficult with different methodologies employed. We measured antibody responses against 307 P. vivax proteins at the time of P. vivax infection, and at 2-3 later time-points in three countries. We observed that seropositivity rates at the time of infection were highest in Thailand, followed by Brazil then PNG, reflecting the level of antigenic input. The majority of sero-reactive antigens in all sites induced short-lived antibody responses with estimated half-lives of less than 6 months, although there was a trend towards longer-lived responses in PNG children. Despite these differences, IgG seropositivity rates, magnitude and longevity were highly and significantly rank-correlated between the different regions, suggesting such features are reflective of the individual protein.'}]}]\n"
