It is characterized as a sex-linked heterogonous disorder with variable severity and incomplete penetrance giving rise to a variable pattern of inheritance. Although Hirschsprung's disease occurs as an isolated phenotype in at least 70% of cases, it is not infrequently associated with a number of congenital abnormalities and associated syndromes, demonstrating a spectrum of congenital anomalies. Certain of these syndromic phenotypes have been linked to distinct genetic sites, indicating underlying genetic associations of the disease and probable gene-gene interaction, in its pathogenesis. These associations with HSCR include Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies, Waardenburg syndrome and other Dominant sensorineural deafness, the Congenital Central Hypoventilation and Mowat-Wilson and other brain-related syndromes, as well as the MEN2 and other tumour associations. A number of other autosomal recessive syndromes include the Shah-Waardenburg, the Bardet-Biedl and Cartilage-hair hypoplasia, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndromes and other syndromes related to cholesterol and fat metabolism among others. The genetics of Hirschsprung's disease are highly complex with the majority of known genetic sites relating to the main susceptibility pathways (RET an EDNRB). Non-syndromic non-familial, short-segment HSCR appears to represent a non-Mendelian condition with variable expression and sex-dependent penetrance. Syndromic and familial forms, on the other hand, have complex patterns of inheritance and being reported as autosomal dominant, recessive and polygenic patterns of inheritance. The phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance observed in Hirschsprung's disease could also be explained by the involvement of modifier genes, especially in its syndromic forms. In this review, we look at the chromosomal and Mendelian associations and their underlying signalling pathways, to obtain a better understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in developing aganglionosis of the distal bowel.\", 'score': 0.6989609003067017}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22182845', 'title': \"Modern treatment of Hirschsprung's disease.\", 'abstract': '', 'score': 0.6900192499160767}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24192607', 'title': 'Paediatric gastroenterology: role for nongenetic factors in the development of Hirschsprung disease?', 'abstract': '', 'score': 0.6197864413261414}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1809495', 'title': '[Hirschsprung disease].', 'abstract': \"From forty years new knowledges about Hirschsprung's disease have dramatically transformed classical concepts of congenital megacolon.

Constipation is a major problem in patients operated for ARM, and biopsies from the distal rectum in patients with ARM may not show ganglion cells owing to different reasons, leading to a false positive diagnosis of HD. A pull-through procedure for HD after previous anorectoplasty for ARM always leads to fecal incontinence. The aim of the present study was to assess the incidence of simultaneous diagnoses of ARM and HD in a single large cohort of ARM patients and to demonstrate that biopsies from the anal canal, which are negative for ganglion cells, may mislead to a diagnosis of HD. A retrospective review of our database from 1980 to 2018 identified 164 patients with HD and 2397 patients with ARM. Four patients suffered from both HD and ARM. The incidence of HD in ARM patients was 4/2397 = 0.17%, and the incidence of ARM in HD patients was 4/164 = 2.4%. Our results strongly suggest that the association of ARM and HD is less common than previously reported.

Genetic dissection was successful as nine genes and four loci for Hirschsprung's disease susceptibility were identified. Different approaches were used to find these loci such as classical linkage in large families, identity by descent mapping in an inbred kindred, candidate gene approaches based on naturally occurring mutant mice models, and finally the use of model-free linkage and association analyzes. In this study, we review the identification of genes and loci involved in the non-syndromic common form and syndromic Mendelian forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The majority of the identified genes are related to Mendelian syndromic forms of Hirschsprung's disease. The non-Mendelian inheritance of sporadic non-syndromic Hirschsprung's disease proved to be complex; involvement of multiple loci was demonstrated in a multiplicative model. We discuss the practical implications of the elucidation of genes associated with Hirschsprung's disease susceptibility for genetic counseling.

Moreover, phenotypic assessment of the disease has been complicated since a subset of the observed mutations is also associated with several additional syndromic anomalies. Coding sequence mutations in e.g. RET, GDNF, EDNRB, EDN3, and SOX10 lead to long-segment (L-HSCR) as well as syndromic HSCR but fail to explain the transmission of the much more common short-segment form (S-HSCR). Furthermore, mutations in the RET gene are responsible for approximately half of the familial and some sporadic cases, strongly suggesting, on the one hand, the importance of non-coding variations and, on the other hand, that additional genes involved in the development of the enteric nervous system still await their discovery. For almost all of the identified HSCR genes incomplete penetrance of the HSCR phenotype has been reported, probably due to modifier loci. Therefore, HSCR has become a model for a complex oligo-/polygenic disorder in which the relationship between different genes creating a non-mendelian inheritance pattern still remains to be

factor binding: a molecular dynamics study.', 'abstract': 'The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family that plays a role in multiple cellular processes. Activation of EGFR requires binding of a ligand on the extracellular domain to promote conformational changes leading to dimerization and transphosphorylation of intracellular kinase domains. Seven ligands are known to bind EGFR with affinities ranging from sub-nanomolar to near micromolar dissociation constants. In the case of EGFR, distinct conformational states assumed upon binding a ligand is thought to be a determining factor in activation of a downstream signaling network. Previous biochemical studies suggest the existence of both low affinity and high affinity EGFR ligands. While these studies have identified functional effects of ligand binding, high-resolution structural data are lacking. To gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of EGFR binding affinities, we docked each EGFR ligand to the putative active state extracellular domain dimer and 25.0 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed. MM-PBSA/GBSA are efficient computational approaches to approximate free energies of protein-protein interactions and decompose the free energy at the amino acid level. We applied these methods to the last 6.0 ns of each ligand-receptor simulation. MM-PBSA calculations were able to successfully rank all seven of the EGFR ligands based on the two affinity classes: EGF>HB-EGF>TGF-α>BTC>EPR>EPG>AR. Results from energy decomposition identified several interactions that are common among binding ligands. These findings reveal that while several residues are conserved among the EGFR ligand family, no single set of residues determines the affinity class. Instead we found heterogeneous sets of interactions that were driven primarily by electrostatic and Van der Waals forces.

Therefore, these receptors require ligand-triggered domain rearrangements rather than receptor dimerization for activation. Specifically, binding of peptide ligands to receptor ectodomains transduces signals across the transmembrane domains for trans-autophosphorylation in cytoplasmic kinase domains. The molecular details of these processes are poorly understood in part due to the absence of structures of full-length receptors. Using MD simulations and enhanced conformational sampling algorithms, we present all-atom structural models of peptides containing 51 residues from the transmembrane and juxtamembrane regions of IR and IGF1R. In our models, the transmembrane regions of both receptors adopt helical conformations with kinks at Pro961 (IR) and Pro941 (IGF1R), but the C-terminal residues corresponding to the juxtamembrane region of each receptor adopt unfolded and flexible conformations in IR as opposed to a helix in IGF1R. We also observe that the N-terminal residues in IR form a kinked-helix sitting at the membrane-solvent interface, while homologous residues in IGF1R are unfolded and flexible. These conformational differences result in a larger tilt-angle of the membrane-embedded helix in IGF1R in comparison to IR to compensate for interactions with water molecules at the membrane-solvent interfaces. Our metastable/stable states for the transmembrane domain of IR, observed in a lipid bilayer, are consistent with a known NMR structure of this domain determined in detergent micelles, and similar states in IGF1R are consistent with a previously reported model of the dimerized transmembrane domains of IGF1R.

Although these structures are similar overall to their B-class counterparts, they reveal important differences that define subclass specificity. The structures suggest that the A-class Eph receptor/ephrin interactions involve smaller rearrangements in the interacting partners, better described by a 'lock-and-key'-type binding mechanism, in contrast to the 'induced fit' mechanism defining the B-class molecules. This model is supported by structure-based mutagenesis and by differential requirements for ligand oligomerization by the two subclasses in cell-based Eph receptor activation assays.

An attractive strategy for circumventing this problem is to engineer a protein of interest to be sensitive to a pharmacological agent of choice. Here, we report a chemical genetic method for regulating the catalytic activity of signaling enzymes with a small molecule. This approach uses the interaction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL and a BH3 peptide as an autoinhibitory switch that can be controlled with a small molecule. We applied this strategy to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Intersectin, which is a selective activator of the GTPase Cdc42. Replacing Intersectin's regulatory domains with the BH3 peptide/Bcl-xL binding module generated a panel of synthetic GEF constructs that can be activated with a competitive ligand.

We previously showed that the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis is involved in the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer. Here, we investigated whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands are also involved in the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer. The functional involvement of expression of the ErbB family of receptors and/or EGFR ligands was examined in CXCR4-expressing human gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts, clinical samples (primary tumors and ascites), and an animal model. High concentration of the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), as well as of CXCL12, were present in malignant ascites. Human gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric tumors, with high potential to generate peritoneal carcinomatosis, expressed high levels of EGFR and CXCR4 mRNA and protein. Both amphiregulin and HB-EGF enhanced the proliferation, migration, and functional CXCR4 expression in highly CXCR4-expressing gastric cancer NUGC4 cells. Amphiregulin strongly enhanced the proliferation of NUGC4 cells, whereas HB-EGF markedly induced the migration of fibroblasts. Moreover, HB-EGF and CXCL12 together enhanced TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE)-dependent amphiregulin shedding from NUGC4 cells. In an experimental peritoneal carcinomatosis model in mice, cetuximab effectively reduced tumor growth and ascites formation. Our results strongly suggest that the EGFR ligands amphiregulin and HB-EGF play an important role, interacting with the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, in the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis from gastric cancer, indicating that these two axes may be potential therapeutic targets for peritoneal carcinomatosis of gastric carcinoma.', 'score': 0.47281956672668457}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39832617', 'title': 'Binding of ligands to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor: An overview of methods.', 'abstract': 'The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, which plays numerous and pivotal roles in human physiology and pathophysiology.

After reduction, papilin electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a broad band of about 900,000 apparent molecular weight and the core protein as a narrow band of approximately 400,000.

The buoyant density of papilin in CsCl/4 M guanidine hydrochloride is 1.4 g/ml, that of the core protein is much less. Papilin forms oligomers linked by disulfide bridges, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The protomer is a 225 +/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding thread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures.

The indiscriminate use of acaricides stimulates the selection of resistant tick populations and is therefore ineffective. Understanding the molecular foundations of resistance could help inform the search for new alternatives for tick control. Although the ovary has been suggested as a relevant target organ for tick control, there are few existing studies that focus on tick ovarian tissue. Therefore, we conducted a comparative proteomic analysis on ovaries of R. microplus strains with differential resistance to ivermectin. In resistant ticks, we observed the over-accumulation of proteins involved in several biological processes, including translation, proteolysis, transport, cellular organization, differentiation, and xenobiotic detoxification. We also observed the accumulation of many structural and extracellular proteins such as papilin-like protein, which glycosylation increase its stability-based molecular modeling. Therefore, we propose that ovaries of ivermectin-resistant ticks overcome the negative impact of ivermectin through the activation of detoxification mechanisms and structural proteins associated with the remodeling of the ovary's extracellular matrix. SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding the molecular foundation of ivermectin resistance in Rhipicephalus microplus represents an essential step in cattle farming, which could provide clues and alternatives for tick control. Excessive use of chemicals like ivermectin allows the generation of resistant tick strains in different countries. However, limited molecular information is available concerning the tick's resistance to ivermectin. Detailed proteomics scrutiny in various tick organs will provide more comprehensive molecular information. Thus, we conducted an ovary comparative proteomic-based TMT-SPS-MS3 approach. We highlight in ivermectin-resistant ticks the over-accumulation of structural proteins and enzymes connected to detoxification mechanisms.\", 'score': 0.31864333152770996}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/40259657', 'title': \"New insights into Sti1/Hop's cochaperone function highlight the complexity of proteostatic regulation.\", 'abstract': 'Sti1/Hop is a cochaperone that regulates Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones.

Most lncRNAs are under lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary structures, making it hard to predict them computationally. We introduce an approach to predict spliced lncRNAs in vertebrate genomes combining comparative genomics and machine learning. It is based on detecting signatures of characteristic splice site evolution in vertebrate whole genome alignments. First, we predict individual splice sites, then assemble compatible sites into exon candidates, and finally predict multi-exon transcripts. Using a novel method to evaluate typical splice site substitution patterns that explicitly takes the species phylogeny into account, we show that individual splice sites can be accurately predicted. Since our approach relies only on predicted splice sites, it can uncover both coding and non-coding exons. We show that our predicted exons and partial transcripts are mostly non-coding and lack conserved secondary structures. These exons are of particular interest, since existing computational approaches cannot detect them. Transcriptome sequencing data indicate tissue-specific expression patterns of predicted exons and there is evidence that increasing sequencing depth and breadth will validate additional predictions. We also found a significant enrichment of predicted exons that form multi-exon transcript parts, and we experimentally validate such a novel multi-exon gene. Overall, we obtain 336 novel multi-exon transcript predictions from human intergenic regions. Our results indicate the existence of novel human transcripts that are conserved in evolution and our approach contributes to the completion of the human transcript catalog.

Non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which includes microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), does not encode proteins but has powerful impacts on transcription and translation. Conversely, ncRNAs may impact m6A methylation by affecting the expression of m6A regulators, including miRNAs targeting mRNA of m6A regulators, or lncRNAs, and circRNAs, acting as scaffolds to regulate transcription of m6A regulatory factors.

This EVI1 isoform is generated by oncogenic mutations in the core RNA splicing factor SF3B1, which is mutated in >30% of inv(3)/t(3;3) myeloid neoplasm patients and thereby represents the single most commonly cooccurring genomic alteration in inv(3)/t(3;3) patients. SF3B1 mutations are statistically uniquely enriched in inv(3)/t(3;3) myeloid neoplasm patients and patient-derived cell lines compared with other forms of AML and promote mis-splicing of EVI1 generating an in-frame insertion of 6 amino acids at the 3' end of the second zinc finger domain of EVI1. Expression of this EVI1 splice variant enhanced the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells, and introduction of mutant SF3B1 in mice bearing the humanized inv(3)(q21q26) allele resulted in generation of this novel EVI1 isoform in mice and hastened leukemogenesis in\\xa0vivo.

Differentiation of milk secreting alveoli depends on the presence of prolactin receptor, the downstream Jak2-Stat5 pathway and the transcription factor Elf5. A strict regulation of Rank signaling is essential for the differentiation of the mammary gland and in particular for alveolar commitment. Impaired alveologenesis and lactation failure are observed in both, knockout and Rank overexpressing mice; however, the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for these phenotypes remains largely unknown. Using genome-wide expression analyses and functional studies, we show here that Rankl (RL) exposure leads to impaired secretory differentiation of alveolar cells not only in MMTV-RANK but also in wild-type (WT) mammary acini. Conversely, pharmacological blockage of Rank signaling at midgestation in WT mice leads to precocious and exacerbated lactogenesis. Mechanistically, RL negatively regulates Stat5 phosphorylation and Elf5 expression at the onset of lactogenesis. Continuous RL exposure leads to the expansion of basal and bipotent cells in WT and MMTV-RANK acini.

Of relevance to the production of RANKL in pathologic bone loss, expression of this secreted TNFSF11 transcript is upregulated in Jurkat T cells and primary human T cells upon activation.

A tracing of the individual cells using Fucci cell cycle indicators showed that waves of active DNA synthesis in the S phase during the period 0-48 h are followed by cell-cycle arrest and cell fusion after 48 h. Inhibition of DNA synthesis with hydroxyurea (HU) during the first half almost completely inhibited osteoclastogenesis; however, the same HU-treated cells, when re-plated at 48 h at increasing cell densities, exhibited restored osteoclast formation, suggesting that a sufficient number of cells, rather than prior DNA synthesis, is the most critical requirement for osteoclast formation.

Recent attention has been paid to the receptor activator of the NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL), an accelerator of osteoclast differentiation. RANKL is expressed on the bone marrow-derived stromal cell membrane and induces the differentiation of osteoclasts by binding to RANK expressed on the osteoclast precursor cell membrane. Since the inhibition of RANKL expression can lead to the inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption, the clinical application of RANKL inhibition could be expected to have a major effect on metabolic bone disease therapy. In this study, we investigated whether or not YM529/ONO-5920, a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (a novel minodronic acid), inhibits RANKL expression in a bone marrow-derived stromal cell line (ST2 cells). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that the administration of YM529/ONO-5920 to ST2 cells inhibited RANKL mRNA expression and reduced RANKL proteins as assessed by Western blot analysis. The inhibition of RANKL mRNA expression was reversed when geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway, was used in combination. Furthermore, YM529/ONO-5920 reduced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and similarly, U0126, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor, inhibited RANKL expression.

The effects of RANKL are counteracted by osteoprotegerin (OPG), a neutralizing decoy receptor. Derangement of the balance in RANKL/OPG action is implicated in the pathophysiology of metabolic bone diseases, including osteoporosis. Current therapies used to prevent or treat metabolic bone diseases are thought to act, at least in part, through modification of the RANKL/OPG dipole. The idea of using a molecule that could specifically bind and neutralize RANKL to decrease bone resorption and subsequent bone loss is appealing. Recombinant OPG was initially tested. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against RANKL, is a promising antiresorptive agent under investigation. It rapidly decreases bone turnover markers resulting in a significant increase in bone mineral density and reduction in fracture risk.

To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the effects induced by dynamic and static acceleration, we investigated the scale osteoblast- and osteoclast-specific marker gene expression involving osteoblast-osteoclast communication molecules. Osteoblasts express RANKL, which binds to the osteoclast surface receptor, RANK, and stimulates bone resorption. OPG, on the other hand, is secreted by osteoblast as a decoy receptor for RANKL, prevents RANKL from binding to RANK and thus prevents bone resorption. Therefore, the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway contributes to the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by osteoblasts.

From 2 ovarian cancer patients and a healthy control, total RNA was isolated from their serum, tissue, and ascites, respectively, and analyzed by a microarray.

Recently, it has become clear that alterations in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of several human malignancies. In this review we discuss current data concerning the accumulating evidence of the role of miRNAs in EOC pathogenesis and tumor characterization; their dysregulated expression in EOC; and their still undefined role in diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of response to therapy. The most frequently deregulated miRNAs are members of the let-7 and miR-200 families, the latter involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is part of normal ovarian surface epithelium physiology, being the key regulator of the post-ovulatory repair process, and failure to undergo EMT may be one of the events leading to transformation.

A class of small noncoding RNAs, or microRNAs, was found to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Some, but not all, of the data indicated that the miR-200 family was dysregulated in a variety of malignancies. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-200a and E-cadherin were significantly upregulated in EOC compared to benign epithelial ovarian cysts and normal ovarian tissues. However, further stratification of the subject indicated that the expression levels of miR-200a were significantly downregulated in late-stage (FIGO III+V) and grade 3 groups compared with early stage (FIGO I+II) and grade 1 to 2 groups. Similarly, relatively low levels of miR-200a were observed in the lymph compared to the node-negative group.

The goal of this study is to develop and validate a miRNA expression profile that can differentiate the OSC at early and advanced stages and study its correlation with the prognosis of OSC. To identify a unique microRNA (miRNA) pattern associated with the progression of OSC at early and advanced stages, a miRNA microarray was performed using Chinese tumor bank specimens of patients with OSC stage I or III in a retrospective analysis. The expression of four dysregulated miRNAs was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in an external cohort of 51 cases of OSC samples at stages I and III. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to analyze the correlation between the expression of some miRNAs and prognosis. Of the 768 miRNAs analyzed in the microarray, 26 miRNAs were significantly either up- or downregulated, with at least a 2-fold difference, in OSC stage I compared with stage III. The qRT-PCR results showed that miR-510, miR-509-5p, and miR-508-3p were significantly downregulated and that miR-483-5p was upregulated in stage III OSC compared with stage I, which was consistent with the microarray results.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have shown diagnostic and prognostic potential in stage III and IV EOCs, but the small number of patients diagnosed with stage I EOC has so far prevented an investigation of its molecular features. We profiled miRNA expression in stage I EOC tumours to assess whether there is a miRNA signature associated with overall and progression-free survival (PFS) in stage I EOC. We analysed tumour samples from 144 patients (29 of whom relapsed) with stage I EOC gathered from two independent tumour tissue collections (A and B), both with a median follow-up of 9 years. 89 samples from tumour tissue collection A were stratified into a training set (51 samples, 15 of which were from patients who relapsed) for miRNA signature generation, and into a validation set (38 samples, seven of which were from patients who relapsed) for signature validation. Tumour tissue collection B (55 samples, seven of which were from patients who relapsed) was used as an independent test set. The Cox proportional hazards model and the log-rank test were used to assess the correlation of quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)-validated miRNAs with overall survival and PFS.

This review focuses on treatment of MG, mainly on the use of the AChE inhibitor pyridostigmine. Despite a lack of data from well controlled clinical trials to support their use, AChE inhibitors, of which pyridostigmine is the most commonly used, are recommended as first-line therapy for MG. Pyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is generally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients with generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in patients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy.

Immune modulators address the underlying autoimmune process in myasthenia gravis, but are associated with potential complications and side effects. Most patients with generalized myasthenia who have significant weakness beyond the ocular muscles and who remain symptomatic, despite treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, are candidates for immune modulation. Although corticosteroids are effective for long-term immune modulation in myasthenia gravis, several more contemporary immunomodulators including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil have shown efficacy in myasthenia gravis and are used increasingly as first-line treatments and as steroid-sparing agents.

Experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) has been produced in a variety of animals by immunization with AChR or AChR-like material, or by the passive transfer of anti-AChR antibodies or lymphocytes from afflicted animals into normal animals. EAMG is a remarkably faithful model of human myasthenia and has provided much information about how the immune response to AChR progresses and how weakness and damage to the neuromuscular junction ensure. EAMG has also allowed the development of a number of revolutionary forms of treatment in which only the abnormal response to AChR is restrained, and other necessary immune functions are left intact.

In a study of autopsies of patients with prostate cancer, 65%-75% had bone metastases. Bone metastases place a substantial economic burden on payers with estimated total annual costs of $1.9 billion in the United States. Skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery to bone, and radiation to bone, affect approximately 50% of patients with bone metastases. They are associated with a decreased quality of life and increased health care costs. Zoledronic acid is an effective treatment in preventing SREs in solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Recently, denosumab was FDA-approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. A Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT00321620) demonstrated that denosumab had superior efficacy in delaying first and subsequent SREs compared with zoledronic acid. However, the economic value of denosumab has not been assessed in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. To compare the cost-effectiveness of denosumab with zoledronic acid in the treatment of bone metastases in men with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. An Excel-based Markov model was developed to assess costs and effectiveness associated with the 2 treatments over a 1- and 3-year time horizon. Because the evaluation was conducted from the perspective of a U.S. third-party payer, only direct costs were included. Consistent with the primary outcome in the Phase 3 trial, effectiveness was assessed based on the number of SREs. The model consisted of 9 health states defined by SRE occurrence, SRE history, disease progression, and death. A hypothetical cohort of patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer received either denosumab 120 mg or zoledronic acid 4 mg at the model entry and transitioned among the 9 health states at the beginning of each 13-week cycle. Transition probabilities associated with experiencing the first SRE, subsequent SREs, disease progression, and death were primarily derived from the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial and were supplemented with published literature. The model assumed that a maximum of 1 SRE could occur in each cycle. Drug costs included wholesale acquisition cost, health care professional costs associated with drug administration, and drug monitoring costs, if applicable. Nondrug costs included incremental costs associated with disease progression, costs associated with SREs, and terminal care costs, which were derived from the literature. Adverse event (AE) costs were estimated based on the incidence rates reported in the Phase 3 trial. Resource utilization associated with AEs was estimated based on consultation with a senior medical director employed by the study sponsor. All costs were presented in 2010 dollars. The base case estimated the incremental total cost per SRE avoided over a 1-year time horizon. Results for a 3-year time horizon were also estimated. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to test the robustness of the model. In the base case, the total per patient costs incurred over 1 year were estimated at $35,341 ($19,230 drug costs and $16,111 nondrug costs) for denosumab and $27,528 ($10,960 drug costs and $16,569 nondrug costs) for zoledronic acid, with an incremental total direct cost of $7,813 for denosumab. The estimated numbers of SREs per patient during the 1-year period were 0.49 for denosumab and 0.60 for zoledronic acid, resulting in an incremental number of SREs of -0.11 in the denosumab arm. The estimated incremental total direct costs per SRE avoided with the use of denosumab instead of zoledronic acid were $71,027 for 1 year and $51,319 for 3 years. The 1-way sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were sensitive to the drug costs, median time to first SRE, and increased risk of SRE associated with disease progression. Results of the PSA showed that based on willingness-to-pay thresholds of $70,000, $50,000, and $30,000 per SRE avoided, respectively, denosumab was cost-effective compared with zoledronic acid in 49.5%, 17.5%, and 0.3% of the cases at 1 year, respectively, and 79.0%, 49.8%, and 4.1% of the cases at 3 years, respectively.

In this study, we conducted RNC-seq (ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound RNA sequencing) and RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) analyses on the longissimus dorsi muscle of Duroc pigs (a lean breed) and Luchuan pigs (a fat breed) to uncover the genetic basis for the divergent IMF content. The results show that the overall translation level of Luchuan pigs is significantly higher than Duroc pigs, while there is no significant difference in the transcription level. Enzymes related to fatty acid synthesis and elongation, such as ACACA, FASN, and ELOVL5, are significantly up-regulated at the translation level, while enzymes associated with fatty acid degradation, namely ALDH1B1 and ALDH2, are significantly down-regulated. However, there is no significant difference in their transcription levels. qRT-PCR and Western Blotting experiments for ELOVL5 confirm the reliability of the sequencing results. Additionally, the translation initiation factor eIF4A1, known to positively regulate gene translation, displayed higher expression in Luchuan pigs rather than in Duroc pigs and the 5'UTR structural features of genes involved in translation up-regulation matched the mRNA selectivity of eIF4A1. In conclusion, these findings suggest the up-regulation of the eIF4A1 gene expression in Luchuan pigs may elevate the translation levels of genes related to lipid synthesis through translational regulation, further resulting in an increase in IMF content.\", 'score': 0.3832562267780304}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37967251', 'title': 'Transcript Isoform Diversity of Ampliconic Genes on the Y Chromosome of Great Apes.', 'abstract': 'Y chromosomal ampliconic genes (YAGs) are important for male fertility, as they encode proteins functioning in spermatogenesis. The variation in copy number and expression levels of these multicopy gene families has been studied in great apes; however, the diversity of splicing variants remains unexplored. Here, we deciphered the sequences of polyadenylated transcripts of all nine YAG families (BPY2, CDY, DAZ, HSFY, PRY, RBMY, TSPY, VCY, and XKRY) from testis samples of six great ape species (human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, and Sumatran orangutan). To achieve this, we enriched YAG transcripts with capture probe hybridization and sequenced them with long (Pacific Biosciences) reads. Our analysis of this data set resulted in several findings. First, we observed evolutionarily conserved alternative splicing patterns for most YAG families except for BPY2 and PRY. Second, our results suggest that BPY2 transcripts and proteins originate from separate genomic regions in bonobo versus human, which is possibly facilitated by acquiring new promoters. Third, our analysis indicates that the PRY gene family, having the highest representation of noncoding transcripts, has been undergoing pseudogenization. Fourth, we have not detected signatures of selection in the five YAG families shared among great apes, even though we identified many species-specific protein-coding transcripts.

However, its function in largemouth bass iridovirus (LMBV) infection remains uncertain. Here, a STING homolog (MsSTING) from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) was cloned and characterized. MsSTING encoded a 407-amino-acid polypeptide, which shared 84.08% and 41.45% identity with golden perch (Perca flavescens) and human (Homo sapiens) homologs, respectively. MsSTING contained four transmembrane domains and a conserved C-terminal domain. The mRNA level of MsSTING was significantly increased in response to LMBV infection in vitro. Subcellular localization observation indicated that MsSTING encoded a cytoplasmic protein, which co-localized predominantly with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and partially with mitochondria. Moreover, its accurate localization was dependent on the N-terminal transmembrane motif (TM) domains. MsSTING was able to activate interferon (IFN) response, evidenced by the activation of IFN1, IFN3 and ISRE promoters by its overexpression in vitro. Mutant analysis showed that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domain of MsSTING were essential for its activation on IFN response. In addition, overexpression of MsSTING inhibited the transcription and protein levels of viral core genes, indicating that MsSTING exerted antiviral action against LMBV. Consistently, the inhibitory effects were significantly attenuated when the N-terminal or C-terminal domains of MsSTING was deleted.

Here we generated a library of short human putative de novo proteins of varying lengths and ages and sorted the candidates according to their structural compactness and disorder propensity. Using Förster resonance energy transfer combined with Fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we were able to screen the library for most compact protein structures, as well as most elongated and flexible structures. We find that compact de novo proteins are on average slightly shorter and contain lower predicted disorder than less compact ones. The predicted structures for most and least compact de novo proteins correspond to expectations in that they contain more secondary structure content or higher disorder content, respectively.

Thus, the Vaughan Williams classification also coincides with the main myocardial targets of the antiarrhythmics, i.e., myocardial sodium-, potassium-, and calcium-channels or beta-adrenergic receptors. A more detailed characterization which is also based on the myocardial targets of a drug is given by the \"Sicilian Gambit\" approach of classification. Nevertheless, the appropriate drug for the management of a given clinical arrhythmia has to be chosen according to the electrophysiological effects of the respective drug. A main determinant of the antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic properties of a drug is the frequency dependence of its electrophysiological effects. The sodium-channel blockade induced by class-I substances is enhanced with increasing heart rates. Thus, class-I antiarrhythmics can be subclassified as substances showing a more exponential, an approximately linear, or rather saturated block-frequency relation. Class-III antiarrhythmics (potassium-channel blockade) can be further differentiated according to the component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) which is inhibited by a drug. Class-III drugs inhibiting selectively the rapidly activating and deactivating IKr component exhibit a marked reverse rate dependence, i.e., the drug induced prolongation of the cardiac action potential is minimized at high rates. On the other hand, during bradycardia the pronounced action potential prolongation may cause early afterdepolarizations and triggered activity leading to torsades de pointes arrhythmias (acquired QT syndrome). Class-III substances inhibiting the slowly activating IKs component are currently under investigation and are expected to show a direct rate dependence. Experimental data available so far point to an action potential prolonging effect at least independent of rate. However, it is uncertain whether proarrhythmic effects can be thus avoided, especially in light of the fact that one form of congenital QT syndrome (LQT1) seems to be linked to dysfunction of the IKs-channel.', 'score': 0.828441321849823}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1290288', 'title': '[Principles for the classification of anti-arrhythmia agents in cardiac arrhythmias].', 'abstract': 'Clinically useful antiarrhythmic drugs are a group of heterogenous compounds, both with respect to chemical structure and to cellular mechanism of action. The classification of antiarrhythmic agents according to Vaughan Williams is based on electrophysiological findings in isolated heart muscle and defines four classes of drug actions. The criteria for classification include blockade of ion channels (classes I and IV), interaction with receptors (class II), and alteration of electrophysiological parameters, e.g., prolongation in action potential duration (class III). Several antiarrhythmic drugs possess actions in more than one class. The classification does not include all established antiarrhythmics, e.g., digitalis. Class-I action is further subdivided on the basis of extent of Na+ channel block and additional change in action potential duration. The kinetics of the onset and offset of Na+ channel block can be explained by models in which association and dissociation from the receptor are functions of channel state, i.e., activated, inactivated or resting. Detailed analysis has led to the concept of saturation block (24). Recently, the European Society of Cardiology has presented a classification of antiarrhythmics based on a more comprehensive compilation of drug action (18). Any useful classification of antiarrhythmic agents should offer guidance for their clinical use. This goal has not yet been reached. The criteria of classification are physicochemical properties or cellular mechanism of action as detected with sophisticated electrophysiological techniques.

These are classified according to their electrophysiological effects observed in isolated cardiac tissues in vitro (Vaughan Williams, 1989). Fast sodium channel blockers (class I) which reduce the upstroke velocity of the action potential are usually subclassified into three groups, class I A-C, according to their effect on the action potential duration. Beta-adrenergic antagonists (class II) exert their effects by antagonizing the electrophysiological effects of beta-adrenergic catecholamines. Class III antiarrhythmic agents (eg amiodarone) prolong the action potential and slow calcium channel blockers (class IV) suppress the calcium inward current and calcium-dependent action potentials. The classification of antiarrhythmic drugs is still under debate. This particularly applies to agents of class I and III. The effect of class I agents is frequency-dependent because the binding affinity of these drugs to the sodium channel is modulated by the state of the channel (modulated receptor hypothesis). Class I agents bind to the channel in the activated and inactivated state and dissociate from the channel in the rested state. This occurs at a drug-specific rate so that class I agents can be subclassified into only two groups, namely in those of the slow- and fast-recovery type respectively (time constant of reactivation greater or smaller than 1 s). Slow-recovery class I agents affect regular action potentials at normal heart rates which can more easily lead to a lengthening of the QRS duration in the ECG, to conduction disturbances and hence to pro-arrhythmic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 'score': 0.6110742688179016}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8842508', 'title': 'Electrophysiologic mechanisms of adverse effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs (cibenzoline, pilsicainide, disopyramide, procainamide) in induction of atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia.', 'abstract': 'We evaluated the electrophysiological mechanisms of adverse effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs (cibenzoline in seven patients, pilsicainide in two, and disopyramide in two, and procainamide in three) in the induction of orthodromic atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia (AVRT).

In 4 out of 6 patients with a manifest accessory pathway, class I drugs induced unidirectional conduction block of the accessory pathway (antegrade conduction block associated with preserved retrograde conduction) and enhanced the induction of AVRT with atrial extrastimulation. In eight patients with a concealed accessory pathway, the outward or inward expansion of the tachycardia induction zone was observed in patients who had greater prolongation of the conduction time than the refractory period of the retrograde accessory pathway after class I drugs. During ventricular extrastimulation, the induction of bundle branch re-entry after class I drugs initiated the AVRT in patients with either manifest or concealed accessory pathways. We conclude that the adverse effects of class I drugs are mainly due to induction of unidirectional retrograde conduction of the manifest accessory pathway and the greater prolongation of the retrograde conduction time of the concealed accessory pathway than the refractory period, regardless of the sub-classification of class I drugs.', 'score': 0.5400116443634033}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8223746', 'title': 'Pharmacological therapy of arrhythmias complicating dilated cardiomyopathy--implications of the arrhythmogenic substrate.', 'abstract': \"Dilated cardiomyopathy is a global myocardial abnormality in which it is likely that there are relatively homogeneous electrical conditions.

Operationally, receptor activity is regulated by two principal, counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell. Moreover, different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, and together, these phenomena determine the strength, the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling. To date, it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species. In this study, we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands, DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex.

All 4 receptors were expressed in the adult liver, with no significant differences in the levels of Notch-1, -2, and -4 messenger RNA (mRNA) between normal and diseased liver.

Activation of Notch3 has been reported to promote tumor growth in invasive gliomas and to initiate formation of choroid plexus tumors (CPT) in mice. We investigated the expression of all currently known Notch receptors (Notch 1-4) in 55 samples of nCP and 88 CPT, including 61 choroid plexus papillomas (CPP), 22 atypical CPP and 5 choroid plexus carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. Notch expression was semiquantitatively evaluated separately for membranous/cytoplasmic and for nuclear staining. In addition, we examined Her2 expression (EGFR2, Her2/neu, ErbB2, CD340) because of its functional link to Notch signaling. All samples were negative for Notch3. Membranous/cytoplasmic expression of Notch1 (p<0.0001) and Notch4 (p=0.046) was significantly higher, whereas Notch2 expression was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in nCP compared to CPT. Nuclear expression of Notch1, -2 and -4 was significantly higher in CPT compared to nCP (p<0.0001 each). Expression of Notch2 and Notch4 showed a shift from a prevailing membranous/cytoplasmic expression in nCP to a predominant nuclear expression in CPT.

In this study, we analyzed the immunohistochemical staining pattern of four Notch receptors (Notch1-4) and their ligands (Delta1 and Jagged1) in 14 synovial tissues obtained from 14 RA patients. Notch2 and Notch4 were expressed in limited areas in a few samples or in small blood vessels, respectively.

There are four different mammalian Notch receptors that can be activated by five cell surface ligands. The ability to inhibit specific Notch receptors would help identify the roles of individual family members and potentially provide a means to study and control cell differentiation. Anti-Notch antibodies in the form of single chain Fvs were generated from an antibody phage display library by selection on either the ligand binding domain or the negative regulatory region (NRR) of Notch1 and Notch2. Six antibodies targeting the NRR of Notch1 and four antibodies recognising the NRR of Notch2 were found to prevent receptor activation in cell-based luciferase reporter assays. These antibodies were potent, highly specific inhibitors of individual Notch receptors and interfered with endogenous signalling in stem cell systems of both human and mouse origin. Antibody-mediated inhibition of Notch efficiently down-regulated transcription of the immediate Notch target gene hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) in both mouse and human neural stem cells and revealed a redundant regulation of Hes5 in these cells as complete down-regulation was seen only after simultaneous blocking of Notch1 and Notch2. In addition, these antibodies promoted differentiation of neural stem cells towards a neuronal fate. In contrast to the widely used small molecule γ-secretase inhibitors, which block all 4 Notch receptors (and a multitude of other signalling pathways), antibodies allow blockade of individual Notch family members in a highly specific way.

Here, we investigate protein interactions between NOTCH3 and other vascular Notch isoforms and characterize the effects of elevated NOTCH3 on smooth muscle gene regulation. We demonstrate that NOTCH3 forms heterodimers with NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. R90C and C49Y mutant NOTCH3 form complexes which are more resistant to detergents than wild type NOTCH3 complexes. Using quantitative NOTCH3-luciferase clearance assays, we found significant inhibition of mutant NOTCH3 clearance. In coculture assays of NOTCH function, overexpressed wild type and mutant NOTCH3 significantly repressed NOTCH-regulated smooth muscle transcripts and potently impaired the activity of three independent smooth muscle promoters. Wildtype and R90C recombinant NOTCH3 proteins applied to cell cultures also blocked canonical Notch fuction.

This disease is diagnosed primarily in children younger than 5 years and is disproportionately observed in former premature infants. Cytogenetically, hepatoblastoma is characterized by numerical aberrations, as well as unbalanced translocations involving the proximal region of chromosome 1q. The NOTCH2 gene has been mapped to this locus, and it is well established that the NOTCH gene family is an important regulator of several developmental pathways. Specifically, the NOTCH2 protein is known to delay hepatoblast maturation during early hepatic organogenesis, and the reduction of NOTCH2 expression correlates with the differentiation of hepatoblasts into hepatocytes and biliary cells in the developing liver. We hypothesized that NOTCH2 is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma by maintaining a population of undifferentiated hepatoblasts. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of NOTCH2 and its isoforms NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4 and the NOTCH2 primary ligand JAGGED1 in hepatoblastomas. Compared with the normal liver, an increased level of NOTCH2 expression was seen in 22 of 24 (92%) hepatoblastomas. There was no significant staining for other NOTCH isoforms and JAGGED1 in hepatoblastomas. Therefore, we suggest that NOTCH2 expression and activation, independent of JAGGED1 expression, may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma. In the hepatoblastoma sinusoidal vasculature, we saw NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 expression.

This cellular state can be reached by replicative loss of telomeres or certain stresses in cell culture and is characterized by the termination of cell division; however, the cells remain metabolically active. To identify metabolites that are characteristic for senescent cells, extracts of human embryonic lung fibroblast (WI-38 cell line) have been investigated with NMR spectroscopy. Three different types of senescence have been characterized: replicative senescence, DNA damage-induced senescence (etoposide treatment) and oncogene-induced senescence (hyperactive RAF kinase). The metabolite pattern allows (I) discrimination of senescent and control cells and (II) discrimination of the three senescence types. Senescent cells show an increased ratio of glycerophosphocholine to phosphocholine independent from the type of senescence. The increase in glycerophosphocholine implicates a key role of phospholipid metabolism in cellular senescence. The observed changes in the choline metabolism are diametrically opposite to the well-known changes in choline metabolism of tumour cells. As tumours responding to chemotherapeutic agents show a \"glycerophosphocholine-to-phosphocholine switch\" i.e. an increase in glycerophosphocholine, our metabolic data suggests that these malignant cells enter a senescent state emphasizing the role of senescence in tumour suppression.', 'score': 0.5991398096084595}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39592596', 'title': 'Decoding senescence of aging single cells at the nexus of biomaterials, microfluidics, and spatial omics.', 'abstract': \"Aging has profound effects on the body, most notably an increase in the prevalence of several diseases. An important aging hallmark is the presence of senescent cells that no longer multiply nor die off properly. Another characteristic is an altered immune system that fails to properly self-surveil. In this multi-player aging process, cellular senescence induces a change in the secretory phenotype, known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), of many cells with the intention of recruiting immune cells to accelerate the clearance of these damaged senescent cells. However, the SASP phenotype results in inducing secondary senescence of nearby cells, resulting in those cells becoming senescent, and improper immune activation resulting in a state of chronic inflammation, called inflammaging, in many diseases. Senescence in immune cells, termed immunosenescence, results in further dysregulation of the immune system. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to physiologically assess aging changes of the immune system at the cellular and tissue level. Thus, the intersection of biomaterials, microfluidics, and spatial omics has great potential to collectively model aging and immunosenescence. Each of these approaches mimics unique aspects of the body undergoes as a part of aging. This perspective highlights the key aspects of how biomaterials provide non-cellular cues to cell aging, microfluidics recapitulate flow-induced and multi-cellular dynamics, and spatial omics analyses dissect the coordination of several biomarkers of senescence as a function of cell interactions in distinct tissue environments. An overview of how senescence and immune dysregulation play a role in organ aging, cancer, wound healing, Alzheimer's, and osteoporosis is included. To illuminate the societal impact of aging, an increasing trend in anti-senescence and anti-aging interventions, including pharmacological interventions, medical procedures, and lifestyle changes is discussed, including further context of senescence.\", 'score': 0.5976288914680481}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18976161', 'title': 'Cellular senescence: molecular mechanisms, in vivo significance, and redox considerations.', 'abstract': 'Cellular senescence is recognized as a critical cellular response to prolonged rounds of replication and environmental stresses. Its defining characteristics are arrested cell-cycle progression and the development of aberrant gene expression with proinflammatory behavior. Whereas the mechanistic events associated with senescence are generally well understood at the molecular level, the impact of senescence in vivo remains to be fully determined. In addition to the role of senescence as an antitumor mechanism, this review examines cellular senescence as a factor in organismal aging and age-related diseases, with particular emphasis on aberrant gene expression and abnormal paracrine signaling. Senescence as an emerging factor in tissue remodeling, wound repair, and infection is considered. In addition, the role of oxidative stress as a major mediator of senescence and the role of NAD(P)H oxidases and changes to intracellular GSH/GSSG status are reviewed. Recent findings indicate that senescence and the behavior of senescent cells are amenable to therapeutic intervention. As the in vivo significance of senescence becomes clearer, the challenge will be to modulate the adverse effects of senescence without increasing the risks of other diseases, such as cancer.

Mechanistically, the lifelong accumulation of a wide range of molecular and cellular impairments leads to organismal senescence. The aging population poses a severe medical concern due to the burden it places on healthcare systems and the general public as well as the prevalence of diseases and impairments associated with old age.\\xa0In this chapter, we discuss organ failure during ageing as well as ageing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and drugs that can regulate it. A much-debated subject is about ageing and regeneration. With age, there is a gradual decline in the regenerative properties of most tissues. The goal of regenerative medicine is to restore cells, tissues, and structures that are lost or damaged after disease, injury, or ageing. The question arises as to whether this is due to the intrinsic ageing of stem cells or, rather, to the impairment of stem-cell function in the aged tissue environment. The risk of having a stroke event doubles each decade after the age of 55. Therefore, it is of great interest to develop neurorestorative therapies for stroke which occurs mostly in elderly people. Initial enthusiasm for stimulating restorative processes in the ischaemic brain with cell-based therapies has meanwhile converted into a more balanced view, recognising impediments related to survival, migration, differentiation, and integration of therapeutic cells in the hostile aged brain environment. Therefore, a current lack of understanding of the fate of transplanted cells means that the safety of cell therapy in stroke patients is still unproven. Another issue associated with ischaemic stroke is that patients at risk for these sequels of stroke are not duly diagnosed and treated due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. However, recently neurovascular unit-derived exosomes in response to Stroke and released into serum are new plasma genetic and proteomic biomarkers associated with ischaemic stroke. The second valid option, which is also more economical, is to invest in prevention.', 'score': 0.543978214263916}, {'pid': 'http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9624027', 'title': 'Telomerase and the aging cell: implications for human health.', 'abstract': 'Recent research has shown that inserting a gene for the protein component of telomerase into senescent human cells reextends their telomeres to lengths typical of young cells, and the cells then display all the other identifiable characteristics of young, healthy cells. This advance not only suggests that telomeres are the central timing mechanism for cellular aging, but also demonstrates that such a mechanism can be reset, extending the replicative life span of such cells and resulting in markers of gene expression typical of \"younger\" (ie, early passage) cells without the hallmarks of malignant transformation. It is now possible to explore the fundamental cellular mechanisms underlying human aging, clarifying the role played by replicative senescence. By implication, we may soon be able to determine the extent to which the major causes of death and disability in aging populations in developed countries-cancer, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, macular degeneration, and Alzheimer dementia--are attributable to such fundamental mechanisms.

Macroscopically, this process, leading to progressive cerebral volume loss and functional decline, includes memory and motor neuron deficits, as well as behavioral disorders. Morphologically, brain aging is associated with aged neurons and astrocytes, appearing enlarged and flattened, and expressing enhanced pH-dependent β-galactosidase activity. Multiple mechanisms are considered hallmarks of cellular senescence in vitro, including cell cycle arrest, increased lysosomal activity, telomere shortening, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. The most common markers for senescence identification were identified in (i) proteins implicated in cell cycle arrest, such as p16, p21, and p53, (ii) increased lysosomal mass, and (iii) increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) expression. Finally, dysfunctional autophagy, a process occurring during aging, contributes to altering brain homeostasis. The brains of mammals can be studied at cellular and subcellular levels to elucidate the mechanisms on the basis of age-related and degenerative disorders.

Senescent cells undergo stable cell-cycle arrest in response to various stressors, including DNA damage and oncogenic signaling, and exhibit a complex secretory phenotype known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can impact the tumor microenvironment. The hallmarks of senescence include cell-cycle arrest, secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, structural changes, and metabolic alterations. These features, while initially suppressing tumorigenesis, can later contribute to cancer progression under certain conditions. Methods for studying senescence in preclinical models include in vitro assays, ex vivo tissue analysis, and in vivo detection techniques. Emerging therapeutic strategies focus on exploiting senescence for cancer treatment, particularly through the use of senolytic agents that selectively eliminate senescent cells and senomorphic compounds that modulate SASP activity.
