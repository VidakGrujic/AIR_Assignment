       "   'title': 'A Systematic Review of Nanomedicine in Glioblastoma Treatment: Clinical Efficacy, Safety, and Future Directions.',\n",
       "   'abstract': '(1) Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is categorized as a grade IV astrocytoma by the World Health Organization (WHO), representing the most aggressive and prevalent form of glioma. It presents a significant clinical challenge, with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy and safety of various nanotherapy approaches for GBM and explores future directions in tumor management. Nanomedicine, which involves nanoparticles in the 1-100 nm range, shows promise in improving drug delivery and targeting tumor cells. (2) Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search of databases including Google Scholar, NCBI PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted to identify clinical trials on GBM and nanomedicine. The primary outcome measures were median overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life assessed through Karnofsky performance scores. The safety profile was assessed by adverse events. (3) Results: The analysis included 225 GBM patients, divided into primary and recurrent sub-populations. Primary GBM patients had a median overall survival of 6.75 months, while recurrent GBM patients had a median overall survival of 9.7 months. The mean PFS period was 2.3 months and 3.92 months in primary GBM and recurrent GBM patients, respectively. Nanotherapy showed an improvement in quality of life, with KPS scores increasing after treatment in recurrent GBM patients. Adverse events were observed in 14.2% of patients. Notably, Bevacizumab therapy exhibited better survival outcomes but with a higher incidence of adverse events. (4) Conclusions: Nanotherapy offers a modest increase in survival with fewer severe side effects. It shows promise in improving the quality of life, especially in recurrent GBM patients. However, it falls short in terms of overall survival compared to Bevacizumab. The heterogeneous nature of treatment protocols and reporting methods highlights the need for standardized multicenter trials to further evaluate the potential of nanomedicine in GBM management.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Canine and human brain tumours exhibit similar incidence rates and prognoses. Recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles derived from human patients (PDEVs) can be loaded with contrast agents and exhibit tumour tropism in murine models. We showed in a previous study that gadolinium-labelled EVs derived from canine gliomas (cPDEVs) can selectively targets murine glioblastoma cells in animal models. As a further step, we investigated the potential heterologous and cross-species tumour tropism of cPDEVs with brain tumours. With the perspective of imminent clinical application as both markers and drug delivery tools, we have successfully established the isolation protocol for cPDEVs and confirmed the aseptic conditions of the procedure and therefore the sterility of the isolated EVs. To assess the functionality of cPDEVs as drug delivery tool, they were loaded with indocyanine green (ICG) and injected into murine models of cancer for in vivo fluorescence biodistribution studies. Biodistribution analysis in mice revealed that ICG-loaded cPDEVs injected into murine models of subcutaneous tumours accumulated exclusively in the neoplastic tissue, even when evaluated 24\\u2009h post-injection, thus showing the cross-species and heterologous selective tumour tropism of the nanoparticles. With these tests, we have established a safe protocol for isolating and loading autologous cPDEVs with various markers, thereby paving the way for the clinical testing phase. These significant findings suggest the potential use of cPDEVs as a theranostic tool in the management of canine brain tumours, with promising implications for translational medicine applications in the future.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma (GBM), known as the most malignant and common primary brain tumor of the central nervous system, has finite therapeutic options and a poor prognosis. Studies have shown that host intestinal microorganisms play a role in the immune regulation of parenteral tumors in a number of different ways, either directly or indirectly. However, the potential impact of gut microbiota on tumor microenvironment, particularly glioma immunological milieu, has not been clarified exactly. In this study, by using an orthotopic GBM model, we found gut microbiota dysbiosis caused by antibiotic cocktail treatment boosted the tumor process in vivo. An obvious change that followed gut microbiota dysbiosis was the enhanced percentage of M2-like macrophages in the TME, in parallel with a decrease in the levels of gut microbial metabolite, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the blood and tumor tissues. Oral supplementation with SCFAs can increase the proportion of M1-like macrophages in the TME, which improves the outcomes of glioma. In terms of mechanism, SCFAs-activated glycolysis in the tumor-associated macrophages may be responsible for the elevated M1 polarization in the TME. This study will enable us to better comprehend the \"gut-brain\" axis and be meaningful for the development of TAM-targeting immunotherapeutic strategies for GBM patients.'},\n",

Epileptic seizures affect the quality of life in patients with glioma. Good seizure control during 6-12\\xa0months follow-up has been associated with gross total resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy of gliomas. Little is known about seizure control during long-term follow-up and about factors which may affect the prognosis of epilepsy in glioma patients. We identified retrospectively all adult patients with diffuse glioma (grade 2-4) associated epilepsy (n\\xa0=\\xa0123) living in Helsinki, who received treatment at Helsinki University Hospital neuro-oncology center during 2013-2015. We excluded patients with histopathological diagnosis prior to 2005. Data was collected from medical records for five years after diagnosis of glioma, or until death. In this patient cohort 49 (39.8\\xa0%) had grade 2 glioma, 19 (15.4\\xa0%) had grade 3 glioma and 55 (44.7\\xa0%) had grade 4 glioma. 29 (23.6\\xa0%) of tumors were astrocytomas, 24 (19.5\\xa0%) were oligoastrocytomas, 15 (12.2\\xa0%) were oligodendrogliomas and 55 (44.7\\xa0%) were glioblastomas. A seizure was the presenting symptom in 87 (70.7\\xa0%) of the patients. The majority, 68 (57.6\\xa0%) patients were seizure-free for at least 12\\xa0months at some point during follow-up and 47 (39.8\\xa0%) patients were seizure-free during the last year of follow-up. Survival for five years from glioma diagnosis (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), lower grade of tumor (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), IDH mutation (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), epilepsy as first symptom (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), younger age (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and lack of progression (p = 0.021) correlated with seizure freedom at the end of follow-up. When the results were analyzed separately in survivors and deceased patients, only progression correlated negatively with seizure freedom at the end of follow-up in surviving patients (p = 0.008). In 5-year survivors, longer seizure-free periods were achieved by patients without progression of glioma (p = 0.040) vs patients with progression, or without focal aware (p 0.003) or focal impaired awareness seizures (p = 0.002) vs patients with only focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. In deceased patients, progression (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) and lower grade of glioma (p = 0.003) correlated positively and focal aware seizures negatively (p = 0.021) with a longer seizure-free period. In all patients, freedom of seizures at the end of follow-up was less likely for patients who had focal aware (p = 0.015) than for patients without focal aware seizures. There are differences in seizure-free times in patients with grade 2-4 glioma and epilepsy. The results suggest that the prognosis of glioma may be the most important factor influencing the prognosis of epilepsy.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma (GB), an aggressive brain malignancy with a poor prognosis of 1.5-2 years, rarely exhibits extracranial metastasis (ECM). However, metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a key driver of GB progression and invasiveness. This study presents a rare case of recurrent GB with scalp metastasis, exploring how metabolic shifts enable GB cells to evade treatment and adapt to hostile environments, offering insights for developing innovative therapies. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was employed to analyze amino acid profiles in both the recurrent and metastatic stages of GB. Systems biology approaches were used to uncover genetic alterations and metabolic reprogramming associated with the progression from recurrence to metastasis. Our analysis revealed distinct amino acid utilization patterns in a patient with a molecular phenotype of wild-type IDH-1&2, TERT mutation, non-mutated BRAF and EGFR, and non-methylated MGMT. During recurrence and metastasis, significant differences in amino acid profiles were observed between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis identified key genomic drivers potentially responsible for the transition from recurrent to metastatic GB. Beyond established risk factors such as craniotomy, biopsies, ventricular shunting, and radiation therapy, our findings suggest that metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in the transition from recurrent to metastatic GB. Targeting these metabolic shifts could provide new avenues for managing and preventing extracranial metastasis in GB, making this an important focus for future research.'},\n",

Special attention was given to glioblastoma and low-grade glioma. Notably, our findings highlighted discrepancies among the analytical tools used, underscoring the necessity of employing multiple methods for accurate identification of DEGs.

By using mRNA as a molecular bridge with ultrapure liposomes and foregoing helper lipids, we promote the formation of 'onion-like' multi-lamellar RNA-LP aggregates (LPA). Intravenous administration of RNA-LPAs mimics infectious emboli and elicits massive DC/T cell mobilization into lymphoid tissues provoking cancer immunogenicity and mediating rejection of both early and late-stage murine tumor models. Unlike current mRNA vaccine designs that rely on payload packaging into nanoparticle cores for toll-like receptor engagement, RNA-LPAs stimulate intracellular pathogen recognition receptors (RIG-I) and reprogram the TME thus enabling therapeutic T cell activity. RNA-LPAs were safe in acute/chronic murine GLP toxicology studies and immunologically active in client-owned canines with terminal gliomas. In an early phase first-in-human trial for patients with glioblastoma, we show that RNA-LPAs encoding for tumor-associated antigens elicit rapid induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mobilization/activation of monocytes and lymphocytes, and expansion of antigen-specific T cell immunity. These data support the use of RNA-LPAs as novel tools to elicit and sustain immune responses against poorly immunogenic tumors.\"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma (GBM) is difficult to cure with conventional multimodal treatment and has an extremely poor prognosis. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a new particle therapy for malignant tumors in the brain and head and neck region. This radiotherapy utilizes a nuclear reaction between neutrons and a nonradioactive isotope, boron-10. In this method, a boron compound is administered transvenously into the body. The boron compound has the property of being selectively taken up only by the cells of malignant tumors, and the subsequent irradiation with neutrons can destroy malignant tumor cells without damaging normal cells. Since the irradiation dose to normal tissues is reduced in BNCT, it may be possible to re-irradiate malignant tumors that recur after radiotherapy. Clinical trials have reported prolonged survival and safety of BNCT in a small number of patients with refractory malignancies, including GBM, but these reports do not address quality of life or activities of daily living (ADL) after treatment, and there is no information on the assessment of local control by imaging. Here, we report a case of GBM that recurred after surgery, 60 Gy of conventional radiotherapy and standard treatment with temozolomide.

Seven squamous and basal cell carcinomas from the oral cavity, skin, lung, and thymus with diffuse POU2F3 immunostaining except one, lacked POU2AF2 expression. Other variably POU2F3-positive carcinomas (n=13) from the colon, pancreas, liver, kidney, testis, endometrium, ovary, and breast lacked POU2AF2 immunoreactivity. All POU2F3-positive mesenchymal and neuroectodermal tumors (n=8), including synovial sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, glioblastoma, Wilms tumor, and melanoma were POU2AF2-negative. POU2F3 expression is a highly sensitive but nonspecific indicator of tuft cell differentiation. Co-expression of POU2F3 and POU2AF2 appears to be a more specific marker, although it may not pinpoint tumors driven by the POU2F3-POU2AF3 complex.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'The growing global burden of malignant tumors with increasing incidence and mortality rates underscores the urgent need for more effective and less toxic therapeutic options. Herbal compounds are being increasingly studied for their potential to meet these needs due to their reduced side effects and significant efficacy. Pristimerin (PS), a triterpenoid from the quinone formamide class derived from the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families, has emerged as a potent anticancer agent. It exhibits broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity across various cancers such as breast, pancreatic, prostate, glioblastoma, colorectal, cervical, and lung cancers. PS modulates several key cellular processes, including apoptosis, autophagy, cell migration and invasion, angiogenesis, and resistance to chemotherapy, targeting crucial signaling pathways such as those involving NF-κB, p53, and STAT3, among others. The main objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current literature on PS, emphasizing its mechanisms of action and molecular targets with the utmost clarity. It discusses the comparative advantages of PS over current cancer therapies and explores the implications for future research and clinical applications. By delineating the specific pathways and targets affected by PS, this review seeks to offer valuable insights and directions for future research in this field. The information gathered in this review could pave the way for the successful development of PS into a clinically applicable anticancer therapy.'},\n",

This case report seeks to enhance the understanding of healthcare professionals dealing with similar cases and contribute to the existing literature on this rare phenomenon. This case report details a patient harboring two different but coexisting intracranial neoplasms. The patient, a 73-year-old woman, presented with behavioral changes and bilateral leg weakness. Initial imaging studies, including CT and MRI scans, revealed the presence of two distinct intracranial masses located in the frontal lobes and the falx cerebri. Neurosurgical, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy were offered; however, the patient's family opted for palliative care. The concurrent presence of two distinct intracranial neoplasms in a single patient underscores the complexity of such cases.

Immune contexture, which includes the tumor microenvironment (TME), plays a significant role in cancer progression and treatment. This study aimed to explore the potential impact between WTAP and ZC3H13 on the immunological characteristics of GBM. We utilized data from TCGA-GBM, GEO and CGGA datasets to obtain platform and probe data. Patients with GBM were stratified into two clusters based on the expression of WTAP and ZC3H13 using consensus clustering approach. Immune infiltration within the tumor microenvironment was assessed using ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA methodologies. Functional disparities were determined through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were also analyzed. Co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify genes associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 and immunity. Validation was performed using GEO and CGGA datasets. Our analysis revealed that cluster1 exhibited higher WTAP expression but lower ZC3H13 expression compared to cluster2. Cluster1 showed higher levels of immune infiltration and TMB compared to cluster2. WGCNA identified 15 genes closely associated with WTAP/ZC3H13 expression and immune scores, notably CTLA4, CD27, ICOS, and LAG3.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of BMAL1 in the immune microenvironment and drug resistance of GBM. GBM cell lines with stable BMAL1 knockdown or LDHA overexpression were constructed, and functionally characterized by the CCK8, EdU incorporation, and transwell assays. In vivo GBM model was established in C57BL/6J mice. Flow cytometry, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and RT-qPCR were performed to detect macrophage polarization. Lactate production, pathological changes, and the expression of glycolytic proteins were analyzed by HE staining, immunohistochemistry, biochemical assays, and Western blotting. BMAL1 silencing inhibited the malignant characteristics, lactate production, and expression of glycolytic proteins in GBM cells, and these changes were abrogated by overexpression of LDHA or exogenous lactate supplementation. Furthermore, BMAL1 knockdown induced M1 polarization of macrophages, and inhibited M2 polarization and angiogenesis in GBM cells in conditioned media. Overexpression of LDHA or presence of exogenous lactate inhibited BMAL1-induced M1 polarization and angiogenesis. Finally, BMAL1 silencing and bevacizumab synergistically inhibited glycolysis, angiogenesis and M2 polarization, and promoted M1 polarization in vivo, thereby suppressing GBM growth.

We compared 2020 incidence rates with projected rates and age-standardized rates to 2015-2019. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess observed survival (OS). (3) Results: In 2020, there was an 8% drop in age-specific incidence rates, particularly for those over 50. Incidence rates plunged by 37% in April 2020 during the first COVID-19 peak but partially recovered by July. For all malignant brain tumors together, the two-year OS decreased by four percentage points (p.p.) in 2020 and three p.p. in 2019, compared to that in 2015-2018. Fewer patients (-9 p.p.) with glioblastoma underwent surgery, and the proportion of patients not receiving surgery, radiotherapy, or systemic therapy increased by six percentage points in 2020.

       "   'abstract': 'The postoperative thrombus attached to the damaged blood vessels severely obstructs drugs from crossing the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB) and targeting residual glioma cells around surgical margins, leading to glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence. A thrombus-bypassing, BBB-crossing, and surgical margin-targeted nanodrug is needed to address this phenomenon. Encouraged by the intrinsic damaged vascular endothelium chemotaxis of platelets, a platelet membrane-coated nanodrug (PM-HDOX) delivering doxorubicin (DOX) for postoperative GBM treatment is proposed and systematically investigated. Because surgery damages the vascular endothelium on the BBB around the surgical margin, the platelet membrane coating endows PM-HDOX with its inherent capacity to cross the broken BBB and target the surgical margin. Moreover, preoperative administration combined with fast-targeted PM-HDOX can realize the potential of bypassing thrombus. In GBM resection models, PM-HDOX with preoperative administration demonstrated significantly enhanced BBB-crossing and surgical margin-targeted efficacy. In particular, the PM-HDOX intensities around the surgical margins of the preoperative administration group were more than twice that of the postoperative administration group due to bypassing the thrombus formed in the broken BBB. In the antitumor experiment, the preoperative administration of PM-HDOX significantly inhibited the growth of postoperative residual tumors and prolonged the median survival time of mice. In conclusion, preoperative administration of a biomimetic platelet nanodrug can be an efficient and promising drug delivery strategy for residual GBM after surgery.'},\n",

In the present study, we analyzed correlations of TANs and peripheral blood neutrophils prior to radiotherapy with overall survival (OS) in GBM (CNS5). RNA-seq expression profiles of patients with newly diagnosed GBM (CNS5) were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and The Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA).

Although it is sometimes difficult to diagnose patients with hemorrhagic-onset glioblastoma at the acute phase of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the progressive enlargement of perifocal edema or the development of contrast-enhanced lesion triggers the diagnosis of glioblastoma within six months. Herein, we present a rare case of glioblastoma in which the diagnosis was delayed as long as 17 months after ICH. A 62-year-old man presented with a headache and aphasia. Computed tomography revealed ICH in the left temporal lobe. Magnetic resonance (MR) images revealed that the hematoma had a mix of isointense and surrounding hypointense lesions on T1-weighted MR images and gadolinium-enhanced lesions at the wall and the septum of the hematoma. An endoscopic evacuation of the hematoma was performed. No causative lesions were found during intraoperative and histological examinations. After seven months, abnormal signals were completely resolved on MR images, except for the small and stable enhanced lesion on three-dimensional gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging (3D Gd-T1WI) at the base of the hematoma, which did not change in size for seven months. However, a large gadolinium-enhanced lesion at the left temporal lobe developed 17 months after ICH. He underwent total resection of the lesion and was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He received radiation therapy and temozolomide but died of disseminated recurrence 31 months after ICH. In conclusion, this report presents a didactic case of glioblastoma in which the diagnosis of glioblastoma was delayed 17 months after ICH whereas hemorrhagic-onset glioblastoma was previously considered ruled out in cases in which six months or more have passed after ICH. In order not to overlook these cases, follow-up with 3D Gd-T1WI is essential in the case of suspected tumor-related ICH and close follow-up is recommended when the enhanced lesion does not resolve after a long period even if it does not grow.'},\n",

Moreover, we established the in vivo mice model to validate its oncogenic effects on GBM progression. Although we did not find significant correlations between UTS2 expression and patients’ clinical characteristics, UTS2 was identified as a valid independent prognostic indicator according to multivariate survival analysis. Knockdown of UTS2 resulted in decreased GBM cell proliferation and migration. In addition, functional enrichment analysis implied UTS2 to be involved in the regulation of the immune microenvironment. In vivo studies showed that UTS2 knockdown suppressed GBM xenograft growth, highlighting the tumor-promoting effects of UTS2 on GBM.

GBM contains a small subpopulation of glioma stem cells (GSCs) that are implicated in treatment resistance, tumor infiltration, and recurrence, and are thereby considered important therapeutic targets. Recent clinical studies have suggested that the choice of general anesthetic (GA), particularly propofol, during tumor resection, affects subsequent tumor response to treatments and patient prognosis. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying propofol's anti-tumor effects on GSCs and their interaction with microglia cells. Propofol exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the self-renewal, expression of mesenchymal markers, and migration of GSCs and sensitized them to both temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation. At higher concentrations, propofol induced a large degree of cell death, as demonstrated using microfluid chip technology. Propofol increased the expression of the lncRNA BDNF-AS, which acts as a tumor suppressor in GBM, and silencing of this lncRNA partially abrogated propofol's effects. Propofol also inhibited the pro-tumorigenic GSC-microglia crosstalk via extracellular vesicles (EVs) and delivery of BDNF-AS. In conclusion, propofol exerted anti-tumor effects on GSCs, sensitized these cells to radiation and TMZ, and inhibited their pro-tumorigenic interactions with microglia via transfer of BDNF-AS by EVs.\"},\n",

We identify the zinc transporter Zrt- And Irt-Like Protein 4 (ZIP4) as a pivotal regulator of the GBM immune landscape. In orthotopic mouse models, ZIP4 drives tumor growth and behavioral changes. Mechanistically, ZIP4 modulates microglial plasticity through tumor-derived extracellular vesicles carrying triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1), a process regulated by the zinc-dependent transcription factor Zinc Finger E-box Binding Homeobox 1 in GBM cells. TREM1 enhances microglial plasticity through the spleen associated tyrosine kinase-Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (SYK-PDK-STAT3) signaling axis, ultimately promoting an immune environment favorable to tumor progression.

Stress granules (SG) (a sub-class of biomolecular condensates (BMC)) are dynamic, membrane-less intracellular microstructures which contain proteins and nucleic acids. The formation and signaling of SGs and BMCs plays a significant role in regulating malignancies. This study investigates whether inhaled CBD may play an intervening role towards SGs in GBM tumor cells. Integrated bioinformatics approaches were preformed to gain further insights. This includes use of Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry to measure SGs, as well as expression and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (eIF2α). The findings of this study reveal that CBD receptors (and co-regulated genes) have the potential to play an important biological role in the formation of BMCs within GBM. In this experiment, CBD treatment significantly increased the volume of TIAR-1. This increase directly correlated with elevation in both eIF2α expression and p-eIF2α in CBD treated tissues in comparison to the placebo group (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). These results suggest that inhalant CBD significantly up-regulated SGs in GBM, and thus support a theory of targeting BMCs as a potential therapeutic substrate for treating GBM.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastomas (GBMs) are dreadful brain tumors with abysmal survival outcomes. GBM EVs dramatically affect normal brain cells (largely astrocytes) constituting the tumor microenvironment (TME). EVs from different patient-derived GBM spheroids induced differential transcriptomic, secretomic, and proteomic effects on cultured astrocytes/brain tissue slices as GBM EV recipients. The net outcome of brain cell differential changes nonetheless converges on increased tumorigenicity. GBM spheroids and brain slices were derived from neurosurgical patient tissues following informed consent. Astrocytes were commercially obtained. EVs were isolated from conditioned culture media by ultrafiltration, ultraconcentration, and ultracentrifugation. EVs were characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, electron microscopy, biochemical markers, and proteomics. Astrocytes/brain tissues were treated with GBM EVs before downstream analyses. EVs from different GBMs induced brain cells to alter secretomes with pro-inflammatory or TME-modifying (proteolytic) effects. Astrocyte responses ranged from anti-viral gene/protein expression and cytokine release to altered extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathways, and conditioned media from EV-treated cells increased GBM cell proliferation. Thus, astrocytes/brain slices treated with different GBM EVs underwent non-identical changes in various \\'omics readouts and other assays, indicating \"personalized\" tumor-specific GBM EV effects on the TME. This raises concern regarding reliance on \"model\" systems as a sole basis for translational direction.

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma: a highly aggressive brain tumor, presents substantial challenges in treatment and management, with surgical intervention playing a pivotal role in improving patient outcomes. Disparities in access to brain tumor surgery arise from a multitude of factors, including socioeconomic status, geographical location, and healthcare resource allocation. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) often face significant barriers to accessing surgical services, such as shortages of specialized neurosurgical expertise, limited healthcare infrastructure, and financial constraints. Consequently, glioblastoma patients in LMICs experience delays in diagnosis, suboptimal treatment, and poorer clinical outcomes compared to patients in high-income countries (HICs). The clinical impact of these disparities is profound. Patients in LMICs are more likely to be diagnosed at advanced disease stages, receive less effective treatment, and have lower survival rates than their counterparts in HICs. Additionally, disparities in access to surgical care exacerbate economic and societal burdens, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted interventions and health policy reforms to address healthcare inequities. This review highlights the importance of addressing global disparities in access to brain tumor surgery for glioblastoma through collaborative efforts, policy advocacy, and resource allocation, aiming to improve outcomes and promote equity in surgical care delivery for all glioblastoma patients worldwide.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Recent studies indicate that signaling molecules traditionally associated with central nervous system function play critical roles in cancer. Dopamine receptor signaling is implicated in various cancers including glioblastoma (GBM) and it is a recognized therapeutic target, as evidenced by recent clinical trials with a selective dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) inhibitor ONC201. Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) of the dopamine receptor signaling will be critical for development of potent therapeutic options. Using the human GBM patient-derived tumors treated with dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists, we identified the proteins that interact with DRD2. DRD2 signaling promotes glioblastoma (GBM) stem-like cells and GBM growth by activating MET. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of DRD2 induces DRD2-TRAIL receptor interaction and subsequent cell death. Thus, our findings demonstrate a molecular circuitry of oncogenic DRD2 signaling in which MET and TRAIL receptors, critical factors for tumor cell survival and cell death, respectively, govern GBM survival and death. Finally, tumor-derived dopamine and expression of dopamine biosynthesis enzymes in a subset of GBM may guide patient stratification for DRD2 targeting therapy.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant type of glioma. GBM tumors grow rapidly, have a high degree of malignancy, and are characterized by a fast disease progression. Unfortunately, there is a lack of effective treatments. An effective strategy for the treatment of GBM would be to identify key biomarkers correlating with the occurrence and progression of GBM and developing these biomarkers into therapeutic targets. In this study, using integrated bioinformatics analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 130 genes that were upregulated in GBM compared to normal brain tissue, and 128 genes that were downregulated in GBM. Based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, these genes were associated with regulation of tumor cell adhesion, differentiation, morphology in GBM and were mainly enriched in Complement and coagulation cascades pathway. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database was used to construct a Protein-Protein Interaction network. Ten hub genes were identified, including FN1, CD44, MYC, CDK1, SERPINE1, COL3A1, COL1A2, LOX, POSTN and EZH2, all of which were significantly upregulated in GBM, these results were confirmed by oncomine database exploration. Alteration analysis of hub genes found that patients with alteration in at least one of the hub genes showed shorter median survival times (p\\xa0=\\xa00.013) and shorter median disease-free survival times (p\\xa0=\\xa02.488E-3) than patients without alterations in any of the hub genes. Multiple tests for survival analysis showed that among individual hub genes only expression of LOX was correlated with patient survival (P < 0.05).GDS4467 data set was used to analyze the expression of LOX in gliomas with different degrees of malignancy, and it was found that the expression level of LOX was positively correlated with the malignant degree of gliomas.By analyzing GDS 4535 data set showed that the expression level of LOX was positively correlated with the differentiation degree of GBM cells CONCLUSION: This research suggests that FN1, CD44, MYC, CDK1, SERPINE1, COL3A1, COL1A2, LOX, POSTN and EZH2 are key genes in GBM. However, only LOX is correlated with patient survival and promotes glioblastoma cell differentiation and tumor recurrence.

       "   'abstract': 'Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumor and are often associated with severe neurological deficits and mortality. Unlike many cancers, gliomas rarely metastasize outside the brain, indicating a possible dependency on unique features of brain microenvironment. Synapses between neurons and glioma cells exist, suggesting that glioma cells rely on neuronal inputs and synaptic signaling for proliferation. Yet, the locations and properties of neurons that innervate gliomas have remained elusive. In this study, we utilized transsynaptic tracing with an EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus to specifically infect TVA and glycoprotein-expressing human glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, allowing us to identify the neurons that form synapses onto the gliomas. Comprehensive whole-brain mapping revealed that these glioma-innervating neurons (GINs) from brain regions, including diverse neuromodulatory centers and specific cortical layers, known to project to the glioma locations. Molecular profiling revealed that long-range cortical GINs are predominantly glutamatergic, and subsets express both glutamatergic and GABAergic markers, whereas local striatal GINs are largely GABAergic. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that while GINs share passive intrinsic properties with cortex-innervating neurons, their action potential waveforms are altered. Our study introduces a method for identifying and mapping GINs and reveals their consistent integration into existing location-dependent neuronal networks involving diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. The observed intrinsic electrophysiological differences in GINs lay the groundwork for future investigations into how these alterations relate to the postsynaptic characteristics of glioma cells.'},\n",

The average annual age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated per 100 000 population and Kaplan-Meier survival curves evaluated overall survival outcomes among Veterans. The Veteran population was primarily white (78%), male (93%), and between 60 and 64 years old (18%). Individuals with a primary brain tumor in the general US population were mainly female (59%) and between 18 and 49 years old (28%). The overall AAIR of primary brain tumors from 2004 to 2018 within the Veterans Affairs cancer registry was 11.6. Nonmalignant tumors were more common than malignant tumors (AAIR:7.19 vs 4.42). The most diagnosed tumors in Veterans were nonmalignant pituitary tumors (AAIR:2.96), nonmalignant meningioma (AAIR:2.62), and glioblastoma (AAIR:1.96). In the Veteran population, survival outcomes became worse with age and were lowest among individuals diagnosed with glioblastoma. Differences between Veteran and US populations can be broadly attributed to demographic composition differences of these groups. Prior to this, there have been no reports on national-level incidence rates and survival outcomes for Veterans.

In recent years, ferroptosis has also attracted great interest in the cancer research community, partly because it is a unique mode of cell death distinct from other forms and thus has great therapeutic potential for brain cancer. Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and fatal human cancer, accounting for 60% of all primary brain tumors. Despite the development of various pharmacological and surgical modalities, the survival rates of high-grade gliomas have remained poor over the past few decades. Recent evidence has revealed that ferroptosis is involved in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, and manipulating ferroptosis could offer a novel strategy for glioma management. Nanoparticles have been exploited as multifunctional platforms that can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver therapeutic agents to the brain to address the pressing need for accurate visualization of ferroptosis and glioma treatment. To create efficient and durable ferroptosis inducers, many researchers have engineered nanocomposites to induce a more effective ferroptosis for therapy. In this review, we present the mechanism of ferroptosis and outline the current strategies of imaging and nanotherapy of ferroptosis in brain diseases, especially glioma. We aim to provide up-to-date information on ferroptosis and emphasize the potential clinical implications of ferroptosis for glioma diagnosis and treatment.

The arrest of the G0/G1 phase of GBM cells was increased after SC treatment. Moreover, SC downregulated miR-21 expression and upregulated PTEN expression in GBM cells. Overexpression of miR-21 partly abrogated the anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects of SC on GBM cells, while exogenous PTEN partially eliminated the pro-proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects of miR-21 on GBM cells.

Introduction of the mutant IDH enzyme into murine glioma was sufficient to recapitulate the transcriptomic and cellular shifts observed in patient samples. We provide transcriptomic and cellular evidence that mutant IDH is associated with a quantitative reduction of suppressive myeloid cells in gliomas and that introduction of the mutant enzyme is sufficient to result in corresponding cellular changes using an in vivo preclinical model.

As its causes are largely unknown, it is essential to understand its dynamics at the molecular level. This necessitates the identification of better diagnostic and prognostic molecular candidates. Blood-based liquid biopsies are emerging as a novel tool for cancer biomarker discovery, guiding the treatment and improving its early detection based on their tumour origin. There exist previous studies focusing on the identification of tumour-based biomarkers for glioblastoma. However, these biomarkers inadequately represent the underlying pathological state and incompletely illustrate the tumour because of non-recursive nature of this approach to monitor the disease. Also, contrary to the tumour biopsies, liquid biopsies are non-invasive and can be performed at any interval during the disease span to surveil the disease. Therefore, in this study, a unique dataset of blood-based liquid biopsies obtained primarily from tumour-educated blood platelets (TEP) is utilised. This RNA-seq data from ArrayExpress is acquired comprising human cohort with 39 glioblastoma subjects and 43 healthy subjects. Canonical and machine learning approaches are applied for identification of the genomic biomarkers for glioblastoma and their crosstalks. In our study, 97 genes appeared enriched in 7 oncogenic pathways (RAF-MAPK, P53, PRC2-EZH2, YAP conserved, MEK-MAPK, ErbB2 and STK33 signalling pathways) using GSEA, out of which 17 have been identified participating actively in crosstalks. Using PCA, 42 genes are found enriched in 7 pathways (cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, translation factors, electron transport chain, ribosome, Huntington's disease, primary immunodeficiency pathways, and interferon type I signalling pathway) harbouring tumour when altered, out of which 25 actively participate in crosstalks. All the 14 pathways foster well-known cancer hallmarks and the identified DEGs can serve as genomic biomarkers, not only for the diagnosis and prognosis of Glioblastoma but also in providing a molecular foothold for oncogenic decision making in order to fathom the disease dynamics. Moreover, SNP analysis for the identified DEGs is performed to investigate their roles in disease dynamics in an elaborated manner.

However, with the advent and explosion of next-generation sequencing, cancer phenotypes are turning out to be far more heterogenous than initially thought, and the classification is continually being updated to include more subtypes. Tumors are indeed highly dynamic, and they can evolve and undergo various changes in their characteristics during disease progression. The picture becomes even more complex when the tumor responds to a therapy. In all these cases, cancer cells acquire the ability to transdifferentiate, changing subtype, and adapt to changing microenvironments. These modifications affect the tumor's growth rate, invasiveness, response to treatment, and overall clinical behavior. Studying tumor subtype transitions is crucial for understanding tumor evolution, predicting disease outcomes, and developing personalized treatment strategies.

In this study, a novel method based on three-dimensional deep autoencoder network is proposed to automatically detect and segment various brain abnormalities without being trained on any abnormal samples. A total of 578 normal T2w MR volumes without obvious abnormalities were used for model training and validation. The proposed 3D autoencoder was evaluated on two different datasets (BraTs dataset and in-house dataset) containing T2w volumes from patients with glioblastoma, multiple sclerosis and cerebral infarction. Lesions detection and segmentation performance were reported as AUC, precision-recall curve, sensitivity, and Dice score. In anomaly detection, AUCs for three typical lesions were as follows: glioblastoma, 0.844; multiple sclerosis, 0.858; cerebral infarction, 0.807. In anomaly segmentation, the mean Dice for glioblastomas was 0.462. The proposed network also has the ability to generate an anomaly heatmap for visualization purpose.

MHO7 inhibited GBM cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, accompanied by a reduction in Akt activity and membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) content. We verified that MHO7 could react with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the second most abundant phospholipid in the plasma membrane, to form a covalent adduct. Pre-incubation with exogenous PE significantly alleviated the pro-apoptotic effect of MHO7, with a concomitant increase in Akt activity and membrane PIP2 and PIP3 content. Since binding to PIP3 is a key step in Akt activation, our results indicate that MHO7 can function as a novel Akt inhibitor. Additionally, MHO7 has a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect with TMZ, and TMZ-resistant GBM cells remain sensitive to MHO7. MHO7 had little cytotoxicity against normal neuronal cells.

Previous work has shown that systemic administration of Decitabine (DAC) induces sufficient expression of cancer-testis antigens (CTA) in GBM for targeting by adoptive T-cell therapy in vivo. However, the mechanisms by which DAC enhances immunogenicity in GBM remain to be elucidated. Using New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) as a representative inducible CTA, we demonstrate in patient tissue, immortalized glioma cells, and primary patient-derived gliomaspheres that basal CTA expression is restricted by promoter hypermethylation in gliomas. DAC treatment of glioma cells specifically inhibits DNA methylation silencing to render NY-ESO-1 and other CTA into inducible tumor antigens at single-cell resolution. Functionally, NY-ESO-1 T-cell receptor-engineered effector cell targeting of DAC-induced antigen in primary glioma cells promotes specific and polyfunctional T-cell cytokine profiles. In addition to induction of CTA, DAC concomitantly reactivates tumor-intrinsic human endogenous retroviruses, interferon response signatures, and MHC-I. Overall, we demonstrate that DAC induces targetable tumor antigen and enhances T-cell functionality against GBM, ultimately contributing to the improvement of targeted immune therapies in glioma. This study dissects the tumor-intrinsic epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms underlying enhanced T-cell functionality targeting decitabine-induced cancer-testis antigens in glioma.

Understanding the causal factors affecting the patient survival is crucial for disease prognosis and treatment planning. Although previous efforts on survival prediction using multi-omics data has yielded useful predictive models, the causation of the correlated genetic risk factors has not been addressed. Recent advances in causal deep learning models enable the study of causality from complex dataset. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed structural causal model (SCM) with normalizing flows parameterized by deep networks to perform the counterfactual query to investigate the causal relationship between gene mutation and OS with the presence of other confounders including sex, age and radiomics features. The query amounts to the question that what the survival days will be if the gene mutation status has been changed, i.e., from mutant to non-mutant and vice versa. The trained causal model will infer the counterfactual outcome given the intervention on specific gene mutation. We apply multivariate Cox-PH model to find the genes associated with survival, and investigate the causal genetic effect by comparing the original and counterfactual survival days in a bi-directional fashion. Particularly, the following two scenarios are considered: (1) intervention on a specific gene with non-mutant status to generate the counterfactual survival days as if the gene is mutant, with which the original survival days of the subjects with that mutant gene will be compared; (2) intervention on the gene with mutant status and perform the comparison with survival days of subjects with that non-mutant gene.

Between the multiregional-derived GSC cultures, we observed only minor differences in their phenotype, proliferative capacity, and global gene expression. Further, they displayed intratumoral heterogeneity in mutational profiles and sensitivity patterns to anticancer drugs. This heterogeneity, however, did not exceed the extensive heterogeneity found between GSC cultures derived from other GBM patients.

Elevated H3K9me3 MtSig was observed in GBM samples, correlating with the G2/M cell cycle and reduced immune responses. H3K9me3-mediated repetitive sequence silencing by H3K9me3 MtSig contributed to these phenotypes, and inhibiting H3K9me3 MtSig in patient-derived GBM cells suppressed proliferation and increased immune responses. H3K9me3 MtSig serves as an independent prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target.'},\n",

To advance therapeutic development, there is a critical need for physiologically relevant BBB in vitro models. 3D cell systems are emerging as valuable preclinical models to accelerate discoveries for diseases. Given the versatility and capability of 3D cell models, their potential for modelling the BBB and BBTB is reviewed.

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor characterized by extensive vascularization. Anti-angiogenic therapy for this cancer offers the possibility of universal efficacy. However, preclinical and clinical studies suggest that anti-VEGF drugs, such as Bevacizumab, actively promote tumor invasion, which ultimately leads to a therapy-resistant and recurrent phenotype of GBMs. Whether Bevacizumab can improve survival over chemotherapy alone remains debated. Herein, we emphasize the importance of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) internalization by glioma stem cells (GSCs) in giving rise to the failure of anti-angiogenic therapy in the treatment of GBMs and discover a specific therapeutic target for this damaging disease. To experimentally prove that hypoxia conditions promote the release of GBM cells-derived sEVs, which could be taken up by the surrounding GSCs, we used an ultracentrifugation strategy to isolate GBM-derived sEVs under hypoxic or normoxic conditions, performed bioinformatics analysis and multidimensional molecular biology experiments, and established a xenograft mouse model. The internalization of sEVs by GSCs was proven to promote tumor growth and angiogenesis through the pericyte-phenotype transition. Hypoxia-derived sEVs could efficiently deliver TGF-β1 to GSCs, thus resulting in the activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway and the consequent pericyte-phenotype transition. Specifically targeting GSC-derived pericytes using Ibrutinib can reverse the effects of GBM-derived sEVs and enhance the tumor-eradicating effects when combined with Bevacizumab. This present study provides a new interpretation of the failure of anti-angiogenic therapy in the non-operative treatment of GBMs and discovers a promising therapeutic target for this intractable disease.'},\n",

Frailty status has been associated with the outcome of many types of cancer, including GBM, although there is still little consensus regarding the specific criteria for assessing frailty status. This study aimed to determine the predictive significance of the modified frailty score (mFS) in GBM patients using haematological and sarcopenia indicators. Between January 2016 and September 2022, we enrolled 309 adult GBM patients. Data on demographics, haematological examination, and temporal muscle thickness (TMT) were collected and assessed. The prognostic relevance of the frailty parameters was established using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional model. The scoring systems were created by integrating these indicators. Variables with independent prognostic values were used to construct the nomograms. Nomogram accuracy was evaluated using the calibration curve, Harrell's concordance index (C-index), and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. Clinical practicality was assessed using decision curve analysis. The baseline characteristics of the 309 participants revealed a median age of 59\\u2009years (interquartile range 52-66) with a predominance of male patients (58.58%). TMT (hazard ratio [HR]\\u2009=\\u20093.787, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.576-5.566, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), prognostic nutritional index (HR\\u2009=\\u20091.722, 95% CI 1.098-2.703, p\\u2009=\\u20090.018), and mean corpuscular volume (HR\\u2009=\\u20091.958, 95% CI 1.111-3.451, p\\u2009=\\u20090.020) were identified as independent prognostic markers.

We conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis aimed at identifying shared dysregulated genes between GBM and GA-MSCs. Through hub gene enrichment and immune infiltration analyses, we explored key molecular pathways and the immune landscape. Additionally, Cox regression analysis was employed to identify key factors influencing overall survival in GBM. The expression patterns and functional roles of hub genes were validated across various cancer types and datasets. Finally, dynamic simulations were used to assess the binding affinity of potential drugs to the targets, further supporting their potential as therapeutic candidates. We identified 32 candidate genes primarily involved in the 1-kappa-B kinase/NF-kappa-B and MAPK signaling pathways, both of which played critical roles in tumor survival, proliferation, and invasion. Notable hub genes included DUSP1, FYN, FLNC, FN1, G3BP1, MYO1B, and WLS, each contributing uniquely to GBM progression. Among them, FLNC was highlighted as a key regulatory factor in GBM progression.

       "   'abstract': 'Despite advancements in the successful use of immunotherapy in treating a variety of solid tumors, applications in treating brain tumors have lagged considerably. This is due, at least in part, to the lack of well-characterized antigens expressed within brain tumors that can mediate tumor rejection; the low mutational burden of these tumors that limits the abundance of targetable neoantigens; and the immunologically \"cold\" tumor microenvironment that hampers the generation of sustained and productive immunologic responses. The field of mRNA-based therapeutics has experienced a boon following the universal approval of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. mRNA-based immunotherapeutics have also garnered widespread interest for their potential to revolutionize cancer treatment. In this study, we developed a novel and scalable approach for the production of personalized mRNA-based therapeutics that target multiple tumor rejection antigens in a single therapy for the treatment of refractory brain tumors. Tumor-specific neoantigens and aberrantly overexpressed tumor-associated antigens were identified for glioblastoma and medulloblastoma tumors using our cancer immunogenomics pipeline called Open Reading Frame Antigen Network (O.R.A.N). Personalized tumor antigen-specific mRNA vaccine was developed for each individual tumor model using selective gene capture and enrichment strategy. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the personalized mRNA vaccines was evaluated in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy or adoptive cellular therapy with ex vivo expanded tumor antigen-specific lymphocytes in highly aggressive murine GBM models. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the antigen-specific mRNA vaccines in eliciting robust anti-tumor immune responses in GBM hosts. Our findings substantiate an increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes characterized by enhanced effector function, both intratumorally and systemically, after antigen-specific mRNA-directed immunotherapy, resulting in a favorable shift in the tumor microenvironment from immunologically cold to hot. Capacity to generate personalized mRNA vaccines targeting human GBM antigens was also demonstrated. We have established a personalized and customizable mRNA-therapeutic approach that effectively targets a plurality of tumor antigens and demonstrated potent anti-tumor response in preclinical brain tumor models. This platform mRNA technology uniquely addresses the challenge of tumor heterogeneity and low antigen burden, two key deficiencies in targeting the classically immunotherapy-resistant CNS malignancies, and possibly other cold tumor types.'},\n",

Therefore, we hypothesized that SelK may be an important indicator related to the occurrence and progression of GBM.

Cellular phenotypes were evaluated by cell cycle analysis, cell viability assays, and xenograft models.

SelK was found to be significantly upregulated in GB samples from short-term survivors (≤\\u20091\\xa0year) compared to those from long-term survivors (≥\\u20093\\xa0years), and its expression levels were negatively correlated with clinical prognosis.

Up-regulation of β-TrCP1, thereby accelerating the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CDK4 and ultimately inhibiting the malignant proliferation of the GB cells.

Interstitial photodynamic therapy (iPDT) holds promise due to its minimally invasive nature and low toxicity but is impeded by poor photosensitizer penetration and inadequate GBM targeting. Here, we developed a biomimetic pure-drug nanomedicine (MM@CT), which co-assembles the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and the first-line chemotherapeutic drug (temozolomide, TMZ) for GBM, then camouflaged with macrophage membranes. This design eliminates the need for traditional excipients, ensuring formulation safety and achieving exceptionally high drug loading with 73.2 %. By leveraging the biomimetic properties of macrophage membranes, MM@CT evades clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system and can overcome blood circulatory barriers to target intracranial GBM tumors due to its inherent tumor-homing ability. Consequently, this targeted strategy enables precise delivery of TMZ to the tumor site while significantly enhancing Ce6 accumulation within the tumor tissue. Upon intra-tumoral irradiation using an optical fiber, activated Ce6 synergizes with TMZ to exert both cytotoxic effects from chemotherapy and unique advantages from iPDT simultaneously attacking GBM tumors in a dual manner. In subcutaneous and intracranial GBM mouse models, MM@CT exhibits remarkable anti-tumor efficacy with minimal systemic toxicity, emerging as a promising GBM treatment strategy.

In the end, 2 NFRGs (EN1 and LOXL1) were identified as crucial for the development of Parkinson's disease and the outcome of GBM. Our study revealed that 4 NFRGs are involved in the progression of PD. The 7-NFRGs risk score model can predict the prognosis of GBM patients and help clinicians to classify the GBM patients into high and low risk groups. EN1, and LOXL1 can be used as therapeutic targets for personalized immunotherapy for patients with PD and GBM.\"},\n",

Protein alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT, encoded by SERPINA1 gene) is an acute-phase protein, and its high expression has been linked with unfavorable clinical outcome in different types of cancer; however, data on its involvement in therapy resistance are still insufficient. We analyzed SERPINA1 mRNA expression in three different multidrug-resistant (MDR) cell lines-U87-TxR, NCI-H460/R, and DLD1-TxR-and in U87 cells grown in alginate microfibers as a 3D cellular model of glioblastoma. Expression of IL-6 as a major modulator of SERPINA1 was also analyzed. Additionally, AAT protein expression in MDR cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence. SERPINA1 gene expression and AAT protein expression were significantly upregulated in all the tested MDR cell lines compared with their sensitive counterparts. Moreover, SERPINA1 was significantly upregulated in 3D models of glioblastoma, previously found to have upregulated drug-resistance-related gene expression compared with 2D cells. With the exception of NCI-H460/R, in all cell lines as well as in a 3D model of U87 cells, increase in SERPINA1 expression correlated with the increase in IL-6 expression.

Her symptoms began several months prior with right foot paresthesia, which progressed to neuropathy ascending from her distal to proximal right lower extremity. Over several months, she developed lumbo-thoracic throbbing pain, which was dermatomal radiating anteriorly. Her pain worsened with activity. A thoracic spine MRI showed a focus of abnormal intradural intramedullary enhancement present from the T10-T11 disc level to the T12-L1 disc level, producing a large amount of edema within the cord. She underwent a gross total surgical resection. The patient had WHO Grade IV spinal GBM per histopathology. The patient received adjuvant concurrent radiation therapy and temozolomide chemotherapy. She continues with maintenance temozolomide along with the compassionate use of Novocure alternating electrical field therapy for the spine. She is being monitored closely by a multi-specialty team. At 32 months post-radiation therapy, her disease is stable with no evidence of progression. She has made significant improvements in her ambulation and symptoms. While GBM is most commonly intracranial, primary spinal GBM is relatively rare. Although established treatment guidelines exist for supratentorial GBM, treatment protocol choices for spinal GBM remain controversial but typically mirror those used for intracranial GBM and include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Alternating electrical field therapy, also known as tumor-treating fields (TTFields), is indicated for adjuvant treatment of intracranial GBM. While further studies of TTFields in spinal GBM are needed, TTFields appear to be a safe adjunct treatment for spinal GBM.

Mocetinostat, also known by its chemical name (MGCD0103), is a novel isotype selective HDAC enzyme that explicitly targets HDAC isoforms inhibiting Class1(HDAC 1,2,3,8) and Class IV (HDAC11) enzymes. It was approved for treating the phase II trial of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010. Our study revealed that different doses of Mocetinostat inhibit the growth of glioblastoma cells, metastasis, and angiogenesis and induce the apoptosis and differentiation of glioblastoma cells C6 and T98G. Western blot has shown that MGCD0103 has many biological activities to control glioblastoma cancer cells. MGCD0103 can modulate the molecular mechanism for several pathways in cells, such as inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway and suppression of HDAC1 enzyme activity in charge of many biological processes in the initiation and progression of cancer. The high doses of Mocetinostat drug significantly induce apoptosis and suppress cancer cell proliferation through increased pro-apoptotic proteins (BAX) and a down level of anti-apoptotic proteins(Bid, Bcl2). Also, the mocetinostat upregulated the expression of the tumor suppressor gene and downregulated the gene expression of the E2f1 transcription factor.

Therefore, this study aims to identify lncRNA signatures applicable to patients with gliomas across all grades and explore their clinical significance and potential biological mechanisms. Data used in this study were obtained from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO datasets to identify key lncRNA signatures in gliomas through differential and survival analyses and machine learning algorithms. We examined their associations with the clinical characteristics, gene mutations, diagnosis, and prognosis of gliomas. Functional enrichment analysis was employed to elucidate the potential biological mechanisms associated with these significant lncRNA signatures. We explored competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks.

       "   'abstract': \"Due to its volatility, photostability, and gastrointestinal toxicity, Perillyl Alcohol (POH), a monoterpenoid component of various plant species, is a chemotherapeutic drug with insufficient efficacy. Many naturally occurring bioactive compounds have well-known antiproliferative properties, including sefsol, jojoba, tea tree, and moringa oils. This study sought to develop an oil-based Self Nanoemulsifying Drug Delivery System (SNEDDS) using tween 80 as the surfactant and Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) or Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) 400 as the cosurfactant; the oils were used in a range of 10-20% to boost POH's anticancer efficacy. The formulations' size, charge, and impact on the viability of glioma cell lines, ANGM-CSS and A172, were evaluated. The developed SNEDDS formulations ranged from 3 nm to 362 nm in size, with electronegative surface charges between 5.05 and 17.0 mV and polydispersity indices between 0.3 and 1.0. The findings indicated that the antiproliferative effect of POH-loaded Nanoemulsion (NE) could be used as a possible anticancer therapy for glioblastoma \"},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents the most common and aggressive malignant form of brain tumour in adults and is characterized by an extremely poor prognosis with dismal survival rates. Currently, expanding concepts concerning the pathophysiology of GBM are inextricably linked with neuroinflammatory phenomena. On account of this fact, the identification of novel pathomechanisms targeting neuroinflammation seems to be crucial in terms of yielding successful individual therapeutic strategies. In recent years, the pleiotropic growth factor progranulin (PGRN) has attracted significant attention in the neuroscience and oncological community regarding its neuroimmunomodulatory and oncogenic functions. This review of the literature summarizes and updates contemporary knowledge about PGRN, its associated receptors and signalling pathway involvement in GBM pathogenesis, indicating possible cellular and molecular mechanisms with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets in order to yield successful individual therapeutic strategies. After a review of the literature, we found that there are possible PGRN-targeted therapeutic approaches for implementation in GBM treatment algorithms both in preclinical and future clinical studies. Furthermore, PGRN-targeted therapies exerted their highest efficacy in combination with other established chemotherapeutic agents, such as temozolomide. The results of the analysis suggested that the possible implementation of routine determinations of PGRN and its associated receptors in tumour tissue and biofluids could serve as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of GBM. Furthermore, promising preclinical applications of PGRN-related findings should be investigated in clinical studies in order to create new diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for GBM treatment.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Glioblastoma is one of the most common malignant brain tumors. Vitamin D, primarily its hormonally active form calcitriol, has been reported to have anti-cancer activity. In the present study, we used patient-derived glioma cell lines to examine the effect of vitamin D3 and calcitriol on glioblastoma. Surprisingly, vitamin D3 showed a more significant inhibitory effect than calcitriol on cell viability and proliferation. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) mediates most of the cellular effects of vitamin D, and thus we examined the expression level and function of VDR via gene silencing and gene knockout experiments. We observed that VDR does not affect the sensitivity of patient-derived glioma cell lines to vitamin D3, and the gene encoding VDR is not essential for growth of patient-derived glioma cell lines. RNA sequencing data analysis and sterolomics analysis revealed that vitamin D3 inhibits cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis by inhibiting the expression level of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which leads to the accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol and other sterol intermediates. In conclusion, our results suggest that vitamin D3, rather than calcitriol, inhibits growth of patient-derived glioma cell lines via inhibition of the cholesterol homeostasis pathway.'},\n",

We focused on the relationship between the differentiation of glioma stem like cells (GSCs) into tumor derived endothelial cells (TDECs) and, anti-angiogenic therapy resistance. Especially we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of drug resistance of TDECs to anti-angiogenic inhibitors and identify novel anti-angiogenic drugs with clinical applications. The mouse GSCs, 005, were differentiated into TDECs under hypoxic conditions, and TDECs had endothelial cell characteristics independent of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway. In\\xa0vivo, inhibition of the VEGF pathway had no anti-tumor effect and increased the percentage of TDECs in the 005 mouse model. Novel anti-angiogenic drugs for glioblastoma were evaluated using a tube formation assay and a drug repositioning strategy with existing blood-brain barrier permeable drugs. Drug screening revealed that the antidepressant sertraline inhibited tube formation of TDECs. Sertraline was administered to differentiated TDECs in\\xa0vitro and 005 mouse models in\\xa0vivo to evaluate genetic changes by RNA-Seq and tumor regression effects by immunohistochemistry and MRI. Sertraline reduced Lama4 and Ang2 expressions of TDEC, which play an important role in non-VEGF-mediated angiogenesis in tumors. The combination of a VEGF receptor inhibitor axitinib, and sertraline improved survival and reduced tumor growth in the 005 mouse model. Collectively, our findings showed the diversity of tumor vascular endothelial cells across VEGF and non-VEGF pathways led to anti-angiogenic resistance. The combination of axitinib and sertraline can represent an effective anti-angiogenic therapy for glioblastoma with safe, low cost, and fast availability.'},\n",

This RNase is involved in the regulation of neuroinflammation through the degradation of IL-6 and IL-1 mRNAs, key pro-inflammatory cytokines for GBM pathology. Reg-2 is a strong inhibitor of the proliferation of human glioblastoma cell lines and blocks their potential to form colonies. Here, we describe that overexpression of Reg-2 stalls glioblastoma cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and reduces the level of transcripts implicated in cell cycle progression. These newly identified targets include CCND1, CCNE1, CCNE2, CCNA2, CCNB1, and CCNB2, encoding the cyclins as well as AURKA and PLK1, encoding two important mitosis regulators. By RNA immunoprecipitation we confirmed the direct interaction of Reg-2 with the investigated transcripts. We also tested mRNA regions involved in their interaction with Reg-2 on the example of CCNE2. Reg-2 interacts with the 3'UTR of CCNE2 in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results indicate that Reg-2 controls key elements in GBM biology by restricting neuroinflammation and inhibiting cancer cell proliferation.\"},\n",

This study proposes a Chemo-Immunotherapy synergy treatment chemically crosslinked hydrogel system that is injected into the tumor to treat GBM. The strategy uses doxorubicin and BMS-1 with a thermo-responsive and chemically crosslinked hydrogel for extended drug release into the affected area. The hydrogels are produced by mixing with Chitosan (Chi), modified Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) with aldehyde end group and doxorubicin and then chemically crosslinking the aldehyde and amine bonds to increase the drug retention time. PF-127-CHO/Chi, which gels at body temperatures and chemically crosslinks between PF-127-CHO and Chitosan, increases the time that the drug remains in the affected area and prevents the hydrogel from swelling and compressing surrounding tissue. The drug is released from the chemically crosslinked hydrogels, prevents tumor progression and increases survival for subjects with GBM tumors. The Synergy Chemo-Immunotherapy also allows more efficient treatment of GBM than chemotherapy. The PF-127-CHO/Chi DOX and BMS-1 group have a tumor that is 43 times smaller than the untreated group. These results show that the proposed chemically crosslinking hydrogel is an efficient intratumoral delivery platform for the treatment of tumors.'},\n",

We have previously demonstrated that KRIBB11 alone induced the apoptosis of A172 glioblastoma cells. However, the molecular basis of its anticancer activity remains unclear. Hence, we aimed to examine the alterations in cell cycle regulators and the relevance of HSF1 activity following KRIBB11 treatment in A172 cells. The expression levels of p21, p27, and p53 were determined using western blotting or real-time PCR. Alterations in p27 levels were induced using small interfering RNA and retroviral transfection. SKP2 degradation was analyzed through a cycloheximide chase assay. p21 and p27 exhibited opposite expression profiles in A172 cells following KRIBB11 treatment, with p21 accumulating and p27 decreasing, respectively. Further experiments revealed that p21 induction could be attributed to HSF1-dependent p53 accumulation, which is responsible for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In contrast, p27 reduction was not reproduced by HSF1 silencing; however, further suppression of p27 accelerated poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage by KRIBB11 treatment, which was partially reversed by p27 overexpression. Thus, the reduction in p27 levels by KRIBB11 appeared favorable for apoptosis, suggesting that p27 functions as an oncogene in A172 cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the decrease in p27 levels following KRIBB11 exposure was mediated by the accumulation of the SKP2 protein, accompanied by a reduction in Cdh1 ubiquitin ligase. KRIBB11 induces apoptotic cell death in A172 cells through two axes: HSF1-dependent p53/p21 accumulation and Cdh1/SKP2-dependent reduction of p27.'},\n",

Utilizing RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling analyses of circular RNAs, circ-HGF (hsa_circ_0080914) was identified as markedly upregulated in primary GBM and found to potentially encode an HGF protein variant (C-HGF) 119 amino acids in length. This candidate HGF variant was characterized and evaluated for its ability to mediate c-MET activation and regulate PDX GBM cell growth, motility and invasive potential in vitro\\xa0and tumor burden in intracranial xenografts in mice. An internal ribosome entry site (IRES) was identified within the circ-HGF RNA which mediated translation of the cross-junctional ORF encoding C-HGF and was observed to be highly expressed in GBM relative to normal brain tissue. C-HGF was also found to be secreted from GBM cells and concentrated cell culture supernatants or recombinant C-HGF activated known signaling cascades downstream of c-MET. C-HGF was shown to interact directly with the c-MET receptor resulting in its autophosphorylation and activation in PDX GBM lines. Knockdown of C-HGF resulted in suppression of c-MET signaling and marked inhibition of cell growth, motility and invasiveness, whereas overexpression of C-HGF displayed the opposite effects. Additionally, modulation of C-HGF expression regulated tumor growth in intracranial xenografted PDX GBM models. These results reveal an alternative mechanism of c-MET activation via a circular RNA encoded HGF protein variant which is relevant in GBM biology.

Through unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing, it is discovered that the BET inhibitor (BETi) Birabresib profoundly alters the processes of DNA replication and cell cycle progression in GBM cells, beyond the previously reported impact of BET inhibition on homologous recombination repair. Through in vitro experiments using established GBM cell lines and patient-derived primary GBM cells, as well as in vivo orthotopic transplantation tumor experiments in zebrafish and nude mice, it is demonstrated that the concurrent administration of PARPi and BETi can synergistically inhibit GBM. Intriguingly, it is observed that DNA damage lingers after discontinuation of PARPi monotherapy, implying that sequential administration of PARPi followed by BETi can maintain antitumor efficacy while reducing toxicity. In GBM cells with elevated baseline replication stress, the sequential regimen exhibits comparable efficacy to concurrent treatment, protecting normal glial cells with lower baseline replication stress from DNA toxicity and subsequent death.
