Genetic data on plasma proteomes were obtained from 10 proteomic genome-wide association studies. Both cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and cis + trans-pQTLs MR analyses were conducted. Bayesian colocalization, Steiger filtering analysis, assessment of protein-altering variants, and mapping expression QTLs to pQTLs were performed to investigate the reliability of the MR findings. Protein-protein interaction, pathway enrichment analysis, and evaluation of drug targets were performed. Thirty-three proteins were identified with causal effects on FG, FI, or HbA1c but not 2hGlu in the cis-pQTL analysis, and 93 proteins had causal effects on glycemic traits in the cis + trans-pQTLs analysis. Most proteins were either considered druggable or drug targets. In conclusion, many novel circulating protein biomarkers were identified to be causally associated with glycemic traits.

       "   'abstract': \"To date, no large scale, systematic description of the blood serum proteome has been performed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. By using microarray technology, a more complete description of the blood proteome of IBD patients is feasible. It may help to achieve a better understanding of the disease. We analyzed blood serum profiles of 1128 proteins in IBD patients of European descent (84 Crohn's Disease (CD) subjects and 88 Ulcerative Colitis (UC) subjects) as well as 15 healthy control subjects, and linked protein variability to patient age (all cohorts) and genetic components (genotype data generated from CD patients). We discovered new, previously unreported aging-associated proteomic traits (such as serum Albumin level), confirmed previously reported results from different tissues (i.e., upregulation of APOE with aging), and found loss of regulation of MMP7 in CD patients. In carrying out a genome wide genotype-protein association study (proteomic Quantitative Trait Loci, pQTL) within the CD patients, we identified 41 distinct proteomic traits influenced by cis pQTLs (underlying SNPs are referred to as pSNPs). Significant overlaps between pQTLs and cis eQTLs corresponding to the same gene were observed and in some cases the QTL were related to inflammatory disease susceptibility. Importantly, we discovered that serum protein levels of MST1 (Macrophage Stimulating 1) were regulated by SNP rs3197999 (p = 5.96E-10, FDR<5%), an accepted GWAS locus for IBD. Filling the knowledge gap of molecular mechanisms between GWAS hits and disease susceptibility requires systematically dissecting the impact of the locus at the cell, mRNA expression, and protein levels. The technology and analysis tools that are now available for large-scale molecular studies can elucidate how alterations in the proteome driven by genetic polymorphisms cause or provide protection against disease. Herein, we demonstrated this directly by integrating proteomic and pQTLs with existing GWAS, mRNA expression, and eQTL datasets to provide insights into the biological processes underlying IBD and pinpoint causal genetic variants along with their downstream molecular consequences.\"},\n",

Using the largest aptamer-based protein profiling platform to date (6,790 proteins or protein complexes), we identified 969 genetic associations with 900 unique proteins; including 52 novel cis (local) associations and 379 novel trans (distant) associations. The genetic effects of previously published cis-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were found to be highly reproducible, and we found evidence that our novel genetic signals colocalize with gene expression and disease processes. Many trans- pQTLs were found to reflect associations mediated by the circulating cis protein, and the common trans-pQTLs are enriched for processes involving extracellular vesicles, highlighting a plausible mechanism for distal regulation of the levels of secreted proteins.

We employed Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses to investigate the associations between mitochondrial-related genes and IBD via integrating multi-omics. Summary-level data of mitochondrial gene methylation, expression and protein abundance levels were obtained from corresponding methylation, expression and protein quantitative trait loci studies, respectively. We obtained genetic associations with IBD and its two subtypes from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Genetics Consortium (discovery), the UK Biobank (replication), and the FinnGen study (replication). We performed summary-data-based Mendelian randomization analysis to assess the associations of mitochondrial gene-related molecular features with IBD. Colocalization analysis was further conducted to assess whether the identified signal pairs shared a causal genetic variant. After integrating the multi-omics data between mQTL-eQTL and eQTL-pQTL, we identified two mitochondrial genes, i.e., PARK7 and ACADM, with tier 1 evidence for their associations with IBD and ulcerative colitis (UC). PDK1 and FISI genes were associated with UC risk with tier 2 and tier 3 evidence, respectively. The methylation of cg05467918 in ACADM was associated with lower expression of ACADM, which fits with the positive effect of cg05467918 methylation on UC risk. Consistently, the inverse associations between gene methylation and gene expression were also observed in PARK7 (cg10385390) and PDK1 (cg17679246), which were corroborated with the protective role in UC. At circulating protein level, genetically predicted higher levels of PARK7 (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.25-0.52) and HINT1 (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.74) were inversely associated with IBD risk; genetically predicted higher level of HINT1 was associated with a decreased risk of Crohn's disease (CD) (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.49) and a higher level of ACADM (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.83), PDK1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81), FIS1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.47-0.83) was associated with a decreased risk of UC. We found that the mitochondrial PARK7 gene was putatively associated with IBD risk, and mitochondrial FIS1, PDK1, and ACADM genes were associated with UC risk with evidence from multi-omics levels.

GWAS data from the IEU database served as the discovery cohort for depression, with FinnGen and GWAS Catalog data used for validation. Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis was employed to examine the interactions between nociception-related genes and depression, and colocalization analysis identified shared causal variants.

Ten of these pQTL were for meat quality phenotypes that co-localized with one eQTL on SSC2 (8.8-Mb region) and 11 eQTL on SSC15 (121-Mb region). Biological processes identified for co-localized eQTL genes include calcium signaling (FERM, MRLN, PKP2 and CHRNA9), energy metabolism (SUCLG2 and PFKFB3) and redox hemostasis (NQO1 and CEP128), and results support an important role for activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway during the initial conversion of muscle to meat.

       "   'abstract': \"Epidemiological and genetic studies have elucidated associations between antihypertensive medication and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the directionality of these associations varying upon the specific class of antihypertensive agents. Genetic instruments for the expression of antihypertensive drug target genes were identified using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in blood, which are associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP). Exposure was derived from existing eQTL data in blood from the eQTLGen consortium and in the brain from the PsychENCODE and subsequently replicated in GTEx V8 and BrainMeta V2. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the potential effect of different antihypertensive drug classes on AD using summary statistics from a meta-analysis (111,326 cases and 677,663 controls) and further replicated in FinnGen cohorts (9301 cases and 367,976 controls). The reverse causality detection, assessing horizontal pleiotropy, Bayesian co-localization, phenotype scanning, and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis were implemented to consolidate the MR findings further. A 1-standard deviation (SD) lower expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene in blood was associated with a lower SBP of 3.92 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.69-5.15) mmHg but an increased risk of AD (odds ratio (OR), 2.46; 95% CI, 1.82-3.33). A similar direction of association was also observed between ACE expression in prefrontal cortex (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.10-1.28), frontal cortex (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11-1.27), cerebellum (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.17), cortex (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.33-1.28) and ACE protein levels in plasma (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.09-1.17) and AD risk. Colocalization supports these results. Similar results were found in external validation. We found no evidence for an association between genetically estimated blood pressure (BP) and AD risk. There findings suggest an adverse association of lower ACE messenger RNA and protein levels with an elevated risk of AD, irrespective of its BP-lowering effects. These findings warrant greater pharmacovigilance and further investigation into the effect of ACE inhibitors, particularly those that are centrally acting, on neurodegenerative symptoms in patients with AD.\"},\n",

We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of NPSUDs yield numerous association signals. However, for most of these regions, we do not yet have a firm understanding of either the specific risk variants or the effects of these variants. Post-GWAS methods allow researchers to use GWAS summary statistics and molecular mediators (transcript, protein, and methylation abundances) infer the effect of these mediators on risk for disorders. One group of post-GWAS approaches is commonly referred to as transcriptome/proteome/methylome-wide association studies, which are abbreviated as T/P/MWAS (or collectively as XWAS). Since these approaches use biological mediators, the multiple testing burden is reduced to the number of genes (âˆ¼20,000) instead of millions of GWAS SNPs, which leads to increased signal detection. In this work, our aim is to uncover likely risk genes for NPSUDs by performing XWAS analyses in two tissues-blood and brain. First, to identify putative causal risk genes, we performed an XWAS using the Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization, which uses GWAS summary statistics, reference xQTL data, and a reference LD panel. Second, given the large comorbidities among NPSUDs and the shared cis-xQTLs between blood and the brain, we improved XWAS signal detection for underpowered analyses by performing joint concordance analyses between XWAS results i) across the two tissues and ii) across NPSUDs.

PNKP gene expression in certain brain regions was protective against migraine, while its plasma protein levels were positively associated with migraine risk.

Although colocalization with gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is often used to prioritize GWAS target genes, systematic benchmarking has been limited due to unavailability of large ground truth datasets. Here, we re-analyzed plasma protein QTL data from 3,301 individuals of the INTERVAL cohort together with 131 eQTL Catalog datasets. Focusing on variants located within or close to the affected protein identified 793 proteins with at least one cis-pQTL where we could assume that the most likely causal gene was the gene coding for the protein. We then benchmarked the ability of cis-eQTLs to recover these causal genes by comparing three Bayesian colocalization methods (coloc.susie, coloc.abf, and CLPP) and five Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches (three varieties of inverse-variance weighted MR, MR-RAPS, and MRLocus). We found that assigning fine-mapped pQTLs to their closest protein coding genes outperformed all colocalization methods regarding both precision (71.9%) and recall (76.9%). Furthermore, the colocalization method with the highest recall (coloc.susie - 46.3%) also had the lowest precision (45.1%). Combining evidence from multiple conditionally distinct colocalizing QTLs with MR increased precision to 81%, but this was accompanied by a large reduction in recall to 7.1%. Furthermore, the choice of the MR method greatly affected performance, with the standard inverse-variance-weighted MR often producing many false positives. Our results highlight that linking GWAS variants to target genes remains challenging with eQTL evidence alone, and prioritizing novel targets requires triangulation of evidence from multiple sources.'},\n",

We measured plasma levels of sRAGE and performed cross-sectional analysis to examine the association between plasma sRAGE concentration and asthma status in 6546 FHS participants.

Association analysis revealed that each 1 SD increment in sRAGE concentration was associated with a 14% lower odds of asthma in FHS participants (95% CI 0.76-0.96).

To address this, a panel of stress conditions, including elevated temperature, pH, oxidizing agents, and forced glycation via glucose incubation, to identify and functionally evaluate critical quality attributes in the complementary-determining and conserved regions of a bispecific antibody was applied in this study. The exertion of various stress conditions combined with an assessment by size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, LC-MS/MS peptide mapping, and functional evaluation by cell-based assays was adequate to identify chemical modification sites and assess the stability and integrity, as well as the functionality of a bispecific antibody.

For example, a few quantitative trait loci (QTL) have been discovered using genome-wide association studies, which will eventually lead to the discovery of causal mutations that are associated with tissue traits. Although some body composition QTL have been identified in mice, limited research has been focused on the imprinting and interaction effects that are involved in these traits. Previously, we found that Myostatin genotype, reciprocal cross, and sex interacted with numerous chromosomal regions to affect growth traits. Here, we report on the identification of muscle, adipose, and morphometric phenotypic QTL (pQTL), translation and transcription QTL (tQTL) and expression QTL (eQTL) by applying a QTL model with additive, dominance, imprinting, and interaction effects. Using an F2 population of 1000 mice derived from the Myostatin-null C57BL/6 and M16i mouse lines, six imprinted pQTL were discovered on chromosomes 6, 9, 10, 11, and 18. We also identified two IGF1 and two Atp2a2 eQTL, which could be important trans-regulatory elements. pQTL, tQTL and eQTL that interacted with Myostatin, reciprocal cross, and sex were detected as well. Combining with the additive and dominance effect, these variants accounted for a large amount of phenotypic variation in this study. Our study indicates that both imprinting and interaction effects are important components of the genetic model of body composition traits. Furthermore, the integration of eQTL and traditional QTL mapping may help to explain more phenotypic variation than either alone, thereby uncovering more molecular details of how tissue traits are regulated.'},\n",

Moreover, the CBG metaprotein was associated with treatment response (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.0148), but this association was attenuated when both IL28B genotype and CBG were included in the model, suggesting that the CBG association may be independent of treatment response. In this cohort of chronic hepatitis C patients, IL28B polymorphism was associated with serum levels of corticosteroid binding globulin, a major transporter of cortisol, however, CBG does not appear to mediate the association of IL28B with treatment response.

In this study, we utilized Mendelian Randomization (MR) to identify potential drug targets for EC by analyzing proteins linked to the disease risk. A total of 734 plasma proteins and 4,479 druggable genes were obtained from recent studies, and two-sample MR analyses were conducted to investigate causal relationships between these proteins and EC. The cis-pQTL data of the proteins was analyzed after filtering. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was the primary analytical approach in MR analysis. Steiger filtering, heterogeneity and pleiotropy tests, Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) analysis, and Bayesian co-localization analysis were implemented to consolidate the results further. Moreover, drugs corresponding to the identified proteins were found in the DrugBank database. Five proteins HPSE, ST3GAL1, CEL, KLK13, and GNRH2 were identified as highly associated with EC. HPSE and GNRH2 showed protective effects with odds ratios (OR) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-0.92) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.54-0.98), respectively. In contrast, increased expression of ST3GAL1(OR, 1.37; 95% CI 1.04-1.82), CEL (OR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.08-1.49), and KLK13 (OR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.04-1.42) were all associated with a higher risk of EC.

However, whether they genetically proxy tumorigenesis is unclear. For causal inferences, eQTL and pQTL were used to determine the role of chemokines and cytokines in pan-cancer. The impact on the tumor immune microenvironment was also explored. This study leveraged summary statistics from respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 109 cytokines and chemokines in 18 types of solid tumors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with the cytokines and chemokines, located in or close to their coding gene (cis), were used as instrumental variables. A two-sample MR design was employed, followed by comprehensive sensitivity analyses to validate the robustness of results. The impact on immune infiltration was investigated using the TIMER and TISIDB websites. Survival analysis was conducted using the K-M plotter and TIMER 2.0 websites. The TISCH and GEO databases were used to carry out scRNA cell analysis.Analyzing relevant proteins using the STRING database and conducting enrichment pathways for GO analysis of the identified proteins. The results of the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method using cis-protein QTL (cis-pQTL) instruments showed the causal effects of TNF in reducing the risk of squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC) and HGF in reducing the risk of head and neck cancer (HNSC).The results were consistent with the eQTL. HGF was associated with better overall survival (OS) in HNSC, regardless of the types of cells enriched. However, high expression of the ligand MET for HGF leads to a decrease in overall survival in LUSC. TNF was related to poor OS in LUSC with no significant impact. However, in CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell-enriched, eosinophil-enriched, macrophage-enriched, and NK cell-deficient types of LUSC, high expression of TNF leads to a poor prognosis, and there is statistical significance. The results showed a significant positive correlation between TNF and most immune cell infiltration, immunomodulator and chemokine in LUSC. HGF is positively correlated with the majority of immune cells except CD56\\u2009+\\u2009cells, as well as some immune regulatory factors and chemotactic factors. According to single-cell sequencing results, HGF is mainly secreted by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in HNSC, while in LUSC, it is primarily secreted by macrophages and CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cells secrete TNF. The GO/KEGG analysis suggests that proteins related to HGF are mainly involved in regulating peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation and positive regulation of the MAPK cascade. Proteins related to TNF are primarily associated with the regulation of I-kappaB kinase/NF-kappaB signaling and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. HGF is primarily secreted by fibroblasts in HNSC and may have a protective effect on the occurrence and prognosis of HNSC. These effects are independent of immune cell influence, and this role may not necessarily be mediated through the HGF/MET pathway. On the other hand, TNF in LUSC is mainly secreted by immune cells like CD8\\u2009+\\u2009T cell, and it may have a protective effect on the occurrence of LUSC. However, it's impact on the prognosis of LUSC through the immune microenvironment may have a different effect.\"},\n",

The QTL design consisted of three families of common ducks that were progeny-tested by using 294 male mule ducks. This population of common ducks was genotyped using a genetic map that included 334 genetic markers located across 28 APL chromosomes (APL for Anas platyrhynchos). Mule ducks were phenotyped for 49 traits related to growth, metabolism, overfeeding ability and meat and fatty liver quality, and 326 soluble fatty liver proteins were quantified. One hundred and seventy-six pQTL and 80 phenotypic QTL were detected at the 5% chromosome-wide significance threshold. The great majority of the identified pQTL were trans-acting and localized on a chromosome other than that carrying the coding gene. The most significant pQTL (1% genome-wide significance) were found for alpha-enolase on APL18 and fatty acid synthase on APL24. Some proteins were associated with numerous pQTL (for example, 17 and 14 pQTL were detected for alpha-enolase and apolipoprotein A1, respectively) and pQTL hotspots were observed on some chromosomes (APL18, 24, 25 and 29). We detected 66 co-localized phenotypic QTL and pQTL for which the significance of the two-trait QTL (2t-QTL) analysis was higher than that of the strongest QTL using a single-trait approach. Among these, 16 2t-QTL were pleiotropic. For example, on APL15, melting rate and abundance of two alpha-enolase spots appeared to be impacted by a single locus that is involved in the glycolytic process. On APLZ, we identified a pleiotropic QTL that modified both the blood level of glucose at the beginning of the force-feeding period and the concentration of glutamate dehydrogenase, which, in humans, is involved in increased glucose absorption by the liver when the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 gene is mutated. We identified pleiotropic loci that affect metabolic pathways linked to glycolysis or lipogenesis, and in the end to fatty liver quality.

Our two-stage study identifies 136 pQTL associations in the first cohort, of which >80% replicate in the second independent cohort and have significant enrichment with functional genomic elements and disease risk loci. Moreover, 78% of the pQTLs whose protein abundance was quantified by both proteomic techniques are confirmed across assays. Our thorough comparisons with standard univariate QTL mapping on (1) these data and (2) synthetic data emulating the real data show how LOCUS borrows strength across correlated protein levels and markers on a genome-wide scale to effectively increase statistical power. Notably, 15% of the pQTLs uncovered by LOCUS would be missed by the univariate approach, including several trans and pleiotropic hits with successful independent validation. Finally, the analysis of extensive clinical data from the two cohorts indicates that the genetically-driven proteins identified by LOCUS are enriched in associations with low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and might therefore act as endophenotypes for metabolic diseases. While considerations on the clinical role of the pQTLs are beyond the scope of our work, these findings generate useful hypotheses to be explored in future research; all results are accessible online from our searchable database.

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and single-cell MR analyses integrating identified druggable genes to evaluate the causal relationship between expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and CA in both peripheral and central tissues. Using peripheral protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data, we further validated the identified targets at the proteomic level through summary data-based MR (SMR) and HEIDI tests. Concurrently, mediation MR analysis was employed to investigate potential mechanistic pathways underlying the role of these targets in CA. Additionally, a phenotype-wide MR (Phe-MR) analysis was performed to explore other potential indications for the therapeutic application of the identified targets. In conclusion, we identified three CA-associated genes in peripheral tissues (VAMP8, MFGE8 and PDGFD) two CA-associated genes in central tissues (GGCX and NPEPPS). In addition, single-cell MR analyses revealed that GGCX was associated with increased CA risk in excitatory, inhibitory and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, whereas NPEPPS was associated with protection in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Finally, Phe-MR analyses indicated possible indications and side effects of the targets. Our study provides genetic evidence for VAMP8, MFGE8, PDGFD, GGCX and NPEPPS as potential therapeutic targets for CA, highlighting their clinical relevance, associated risks and mediators, and providing valuable insights for the development of novel CA therapeutics.'},\n",

To identify therapeutic targets for sepsis and sepsis-related mortality, we conducted an MR analysis on 11,643 sepsis cases and 1,896 cases of 28-day sepsis mortality from the UK Biobank cohort. The exposure data consisted of 15,944 potential druggable genes (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTL) and 4,907 plasma proteins (protein quantitative trait loci, pQTL). We then performed sensitivity analysis, SMR analysis, reverse MR analysis, genetic correlation analysis, colocalization analysis, enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network analysis on the overlapping genes. Validation was conducted using 17,133 sepsis cases from FinnGen R12. Drug prediction and molecular docking were subsequently used to further assess the therapeutic potential of the identified drug targets, while PheWAS was used to evaluate potential side effects. Finally, mediation analysis was conducted to identify the mediating role of related metabolites. The MR analysis results identified a significant causal relationship between 24 genes and sepsis. The robustness of these causal associations was further strengthened by SMR analysis, sensitivity analysis, and reverse MR analysis. Genetic correlation analysis revealed that only two of these genes were genetically correlated with sepsis. Colocalization analysis showed that only one gene was closely associated with sepsis, while validation using the FinnGen dataset identified three genes. In the MR analysis of 28-day sepsis mortality, seven genes were found to have significant associations, with reverse MR analysis excluding one gene. The remaining genes passed sensitivity analysis, with no significant genes identified in genetic correlation and colocalization analyses. Molecular docking demonstrated excellent binding affinity between drugs and proteins with available structural data. PheWAS at the gene level did not reveal any potential side effects of the related drugs. The identified drug targets, associated pathways, and metabolites have enhanced our understanding of the complex relationships between genes and sepsis.

Corresponding whole-exome sequencing and global screening array data of 919 patients with IBD were included to analyse the effect of genetics on protein levels (protein quantitative trait loci [pQTL] analysis). Intestinal mucosal RNA sequencing and faecal metagenomic data were used for complementary analyses. Thirty-two proteins were differentially abundant between IBD and healthy individuals, of which 22 proteins were independent of active inflammation; 69 proteins were associated with 15 demographic and clinical factors. Fibroblast growth factor-19 levels were decreased in CD patients with ileal disease or a history of ileocecal resection.

Drug candidates targeting identified genes were predicted via the Drug Signature Database (DSigDB) and validated through molecular docking. Core targets were identified using the STRING database, followed by molecular dynamics simulations. Two-sample MR analysis showed that genetically predicted 266 genes had positive or negative causal relationships with MVP. Colocalization analysis indicated that 9 genes had a posterior probability greater than 0.75. Subsequent SMR analysis excluded the gene GAPVD1. HDL analysis showed that except for the gene PTPN1, the remaining 7 genes were all significantly genetically associated with MVP, and LDSC analysis further showed that only NMB was associated with MVP. Validation using pQTL data confirmed that increased NMB protein expression reduced the risk of MVP. Replication analysis further verified this conclusion. In addition, SMR analysis of methylation sites for 8 genes indicated that multiple methylation sites played a key role in gene regulation of mitral valve prolapse. PheWAS results showed that targeted therapy for 8 genes did not detect other causal associations at the genome-wide significance level.

Recent studies have linked the concentrations of these proteins in sputum to COPD phenotypes, including chronic bronchitis (CB) and acute exacerbations (AE).

We identified one genome-wide significant pQTL for MUC5AC (rs75401036) and two for MUC5B (rs140324259, rs10001928). The strongest association for MUC5B, with rs140324259 on chromosome 11, explained 14% of variation in sputum MUC5B.

Conversely, MDGA2 (OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.08-1.19), NTM (OR, 1.12; 95% CI 1.09-1.16), PMM2 (OR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.18-1.53), RNASET2 (OR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.08-1.21), and TFPI (OR, 4.58; 95% CI 3.02-6.94) increased LUAD risk. Notably, none of the nine proteins showed evidence of reverse causality. Bayesian colocalization indicated that RNASET2, TFPI, and VWC2 shared the same variant with LUAD. Furthermore, NTM and FLT1 demonstrated interactions with targets of current LUAD medications. Additionally, FLT1 and TFPI are currently under evaluation as therapeutic targets, while NTM, RNASET2, and VWC2 are potentially druggable. These findings shed light on LUAD pathogenesis, highlighting the tumor-promoting effects of RNASET2, TFPI, and NTM, along with the protective effects of VWC2 and FLT1, providing a significant biological foundation for future LUAD therapeutic targets. Our proteome-wide MR analysis highlighted RNASET2, TFPI, VWC2, NTM, and FLT1 as potential drug targets for further clinical investigation in LUAD. However, the specific mechanisms by which these proteins influence LUAD remain elusive. Targeting these proteins in drug development holds the potential for successful clinical trials, providing a pathway to prioritize and reduce costs in LUAD therapeutics.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Currently, the treatment and prevention of multiple sclerosis (MS) continue to encounter significant challenges. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis has emerged as a crucial research method in the pursuit of new therapeutic strategies. Accordingly, we hypothesize that there exists a causal association between genetic variants of specific plasma proteins and MS through MR mechanisms, and that key therapeutic targets can be precisely identified by integrating multi-omics analytical approaches. In this study, we developed a comprehensive analytical framework aimed at identifying and validating potential therapeutic targets for MS. The framework commenced with a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study utilizing two large plasma protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) datasets. Building on this foundation, we performed Bayesian co-localization analysis of coding genes, followed by a full phenotype-wide association study (PheWAS) on the co-positive genes identified through both analytical methods. This approach allowed us to explore the functions of key genes and the mechanisms of co-morbidity associated with the disease. Subsequently, we integrated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis to facilitate drug prediction and molecular docking studies. This study conducted a systematic analysis between two large plasma pQTLs datasets and MS. In the MR analysis, the MR analysis of Icelandic plasma pQTLs and MS identified 88 positive plasma proteins, while the MR analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs and MS identified 122 positive plasma proteins. By comparison, uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS) and glutathione S-transferase theta 2B (GSTT2B) were found to be the positive proteins shared by the two datasets. After false discovery rate (FDR) correction, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was a significantly positive protein in the analysis of Icelandic plasma pQTLs. In the analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs, advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (AGER), allograft inflammatory factor 1 (AIF1), butyrophilin subfamily 1 member A1 (BTN1A1), cluster of differentiation 58 (CD58), desmoglein 4 (DSG4), ecotropic viral integration site 5 (EVI5), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 14 (TNFRSF14) were significantly positive proteins. After Bonferroni correction, AGER, CD58, EVI5, and TNF remained significantly positive proteins in the analysis of the UK Biobank database pQTLs. In the Bayesian colocalization analysis, EVI5 (PPH4\\u2009=\\u20090.9800), O-GlcNAcase (OGA) (PPH4\\u2009=\\u20090.8569), and TNFRSF14 (PPH4\\u2009=\\u20090.8904) were the common positive genes in the two analysis methods. In conclusion, EVI5, OGA, and TNFRSF14 may be potential therapeutic targets for MS. Through the comprehensive application of MR analysis and Bayesian colocalization analysis, we have successfully identified that EVI5, OGA, and TNFRSF14 may be key therapeutic targets for MS. These findings may provide a scientific basis for the development of novel immunotherapies, combination treatment regimens, or targeted intervention strategies.'},\n",

Here we describe CoPheScan (Coloc adapted Phenome-wide Scan), a Bayesian approach that enables an intuitive and systematic exploration of causal associations while simultaneously addressing LD confounding. We demonstrate its performance through simulation, showing considerably better control of false positive rates than a conventional approach not accounting for LD. We used CoPheScan to perform PheWAS of protein-truncating variants and fine-mapped variants from disease and pQTL studies, in 2275 disease phenotypes from the UK Biobank.

Furthermore, mutation-based resistance mapping identifies two SNPs located in the putative Chivosazole F binding site of actin. Comparing chemogenomic profiles and responses to the Chivosazole F-resistant SNPs shows a partially conserved mechanism of action for Chivosazole F and Latrunculin A, but clear divergence from Chondramide.

Integrating CSF proteomic data with dementia risk loci could reveal intermediate molecular pathways connecting genetic variance to the development of dementia. We tested to what extent effects of known dementia risk loci can be observed in CSF levels of 665 proteins [proximity extension-based (PEA) immunoassays] in a deeply-phenotyped mixed memory clinic cohort [n = 502, mean age (standard deviation, SD) = 64.1 (8.7) years, 181 female (35.4%)], including patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 213), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 50) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 93), and controls (n = 146). Validation was assessed in independent cohorts (n = 99 PEA platform, n = 198, mass reaction monitoring-targeted mass spectroscopy and multiplex assay). We performed additional analyses stratified according to diagnostic status (AD, DLB, FTD and controls separately), to explore whether associations between CSF proteins and genetic variants were specific to disease or not. We identified four AD risk loci as protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL): CR1-CR2 (rs3818361, P = 1.65 Ã— 10-8), ZCWPW1-PILRB (rs1476679, P = 2.73 Ã— 10-32), CTSH-CTSH (rs3784539, P = 2.88 Ã— 10-24) and HESX1-RETN (rs186108507, P = 8.39 Ã— 10-8), of which the first three pQTLs showed direct replication in the independent cohorts.

To date, these studies have identified numerous proteins associated with cross-sectional measures of kidney function, as well as with the longitudinal risk of CKD progression. Representative signals that have emerged from the literature include an association between levels of testican-2 and favorable kidney prognosis and an association between levels of TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B and worse kidney prognosis. For these and other associations, however, understanding whether the proteins play a causal role in kidney disease pathogenesis remains a fundamental challenge, especially given the strong impact that kidney function can have on blood protein levels. Prior to investing in dedicated animal models or randomized trials, methods that leverage the availability of genotyping in epidemiologic cohorts-including Mendelian randomization, colocalization analyses, and proteome-wide association studies-can add evidence for causal inference in CKD proteomics research. In addition, integration of large-scale blood proteome analyses with urine and tissue proteomics, as well as improved assessment of posttranslational protein modifications (e.g., carbamylation), represent important future directions.

We carried out the quantitative trait loci (QTL) and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analyses, using the PsychENCODE dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) expression QTL (eQTL) database, as well as the ROSMAP and Banner DLPFC protein QTL (pQTL) datasets. The gene CNNM2 (encoding a magnesium transporter) at 10q24.32-33 was identified to be a robust schizophrenia risk gene, and was highly expressed in human neurons according to single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. We further revealed that reduced Cnnm2 in the mPFC of mice led to impaired cognition and compromised sensorimotor gating function, and decreased Cnnm2 in primary cortical neurons altered dendritic spine morphogenesis, confirming the link between CNNM2 and endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Proteomics analyses showed that reduced Cnnm2 level changed expression of proteins associated with neuronal structure and function.

While many effectors in the ferroptosis pathway have been mapped, its epitranscriptional regulation is not yet fully understood. Ferroptosis can be induced via system xCT inhibition (Class I) or GPX4 inhibition (Class II). Previous works have revealed important differences in cellular response to different ferroptosis inducers. Importantly, blocking mRNA transcription or translation appears to protect cells against Class I ferroptosis inducing agents but not Class II. In this work, we examined the impact of blocking transcription (via Actinomycin D) or translation (via Cycloheximide) on Erastin (Class I) or RSL3 (Class II) induced ferroptosis. Blocking transcription or translation protected cells against Erastin but was detrimental against RSL3. Cycloheximide led to increased levels of GSH alone or when co-treated with Erastin via the activation of the reverse transsulfuration pathway. RNA sequencing analysis revealed early activation of a strong alternative splice program before observed changes in transcription. mRNA stability analysis revealed divergent mRNA stability changes in cellular response to Erastin or RSL3. Importantly, codon optimality biases were drastically different in either condition. Our data also implicated translation repression and rate as an important determinant of the cellular response to ferroptosis inducers. Given that mRNA stability and codon usage can be influenced via the tRNA epitranscriptome, we evaluated the role of a tRNA modifying enzyme in ferroptosis stress response. Alkbh1, a tRNA demethylase, led to translation repression and increased the resistance to Erastin but made cells more sensitive to RSL3.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': 'Nearly 6,000 QTL have been reported for 588 different traits in pigs, more than in any other livestock species. However, this effort has translated into only a few confirmed causative variants. A powerful strategy for revealing candidate genes involves expression QTL (eQTL) mapping, where the mRNA abundance of a set of transcripts is used as the response variable for a QTL scan. We utilized a whole genome expression microarray and an F(2) pig resource population to conduct a global eQTL analysis in loin muscle tissue, and compared results to previously inferred phenotypic QTL (pQTL) from the same experimental cross. We found 62 unique eQTL (FDR <10%) and identified 3 gene networks enriched with genes subject to genetic control involved in lipid metabolism, DNA replication, and cell cycle regulation. We observed strong evidence of local regulation (40 out of 59 eQTL with known genomic position) and compared these eQTL to pQTL to help identify potential candidate genes. Among the interesting associations, we found aldo-keto reductase 7A2 (AKR7A2) and thioredoxin domain containing 12 (TXNDC12) eQTL that are part of a network associated with lipid metabolism and in turn overlap with pQTL regions for marbling, % intramuscular fat (% fat) and loin muscle area on Sus scrofa (SSC) chromosome 6. Additionally, we report 13 genomic regions with overlapping eQTL and pQTL involving 14 local eQTL. Results of this analysis provide novel candidate genes for important complex pig phenotypes.'},\n",

This study employs Mendelian randomization (MR), a widely recognized genetic approach, to unveil intricate causal associations between proteins and BD, leveraging protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) as key exposures. We integrate pQTL data from brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma with genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings of BD within a comprehensive systems analysis framework. Our analyses, including two-sample MR, Steiger filtering, and Bayesian colocalization, reveal noteworthy associations. Elevated levels of AGRP, FRZB, and IL36A in CSF exhibit significant associations with increased BD_ALL risk, while heightened levels of CTSF and LRP8 in CSF, and FLRT3 in plasma, correlate with decreased BD_ALL risk. Specifically for Bipolar I disorder (BD_I), increased CSF AGRP levels are significantly linked to heightened BD_I risk, whereas elevated CSF levels of CTSF and LRP8, and plasma FLRT3, are associated with reduced BD_I risk. Notably, genes linked to BD-related proteins demonstrate substantial enrichment in functional pathways such as \"antigen processing and presentation,\" \"metabolic regulation,\" and \"regulation of myeloid cell differentiation.\" In conclusion, our findings provide beneficial evidence to support the potential causal relationship between IL36A, AGRP, FRZB, LRP8 in cerebrospinal fluid, and FLRT3 in plasma, and BD and BD_I, providing insights for future mechanistic studies and therapeutic development.'},\n",

       "   'abstract': \"Abnormal lipid metabolism is linked to intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), sciatica, and low back pain (LBP), but it remains unclear whether targeted interventions can prevent these issues. This study investigated the causal effects of lipid-lowering drug use on IVDD, sciatica, and LBP development. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were obtained from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium's genome-wide association study (GWAS). Genes near HMGCR, PCSK9, and NPC1L1 were selected to represent therapeutic inhibition targets. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) focusing on these drug targets, we identified causal effects of PCSK9, HMGCR, and NPC1L1 on the risk of developing IVDD, sciatica, and LBP, with coronary heart disease risk serving as a positive control. Using summary data from Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis, we evaluated potential therapeutic targets for IVDD, sciatica, and LBP through protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL). The genetic associations with IVDD, sciatica, LBP, and coronary heart disease were derived from FinnGen (discovery) and UK Biobank (replication). Additionally, a cross-sectional observational study was performed using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to further investigate the connection between LBP and statin use, with a sample size of 4343 participants. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the outcomes. The NHANES-based cross-sectional study indicated that non-statin use was associated with an increased risk of developing LBP (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.29, 95% CI [1.04, 1.59], P\\u2009=\\u20090.019). Moreover, Inverse-variance weighting (IVW) analysis revealed that NPC1L1-mediated reductions in TC, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C concentrations were associated with a decreased risk of developing IVDD (P\\u2009=\\u20099.956E-03; P\\u2009=\\u20093.516E-02; P\\u2009=\\u20091.253E-04).

Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability and reliability of the MR results. MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1) levels was inversely associated with IVDD, sciatica, and LBP risks. The results of cross-sectional study suggested that non-use of statins was positively correlated with LBP. The results of Mendelian randomization study suggest that NPC1L1 could lower the risk of developing IVDD by reducing TC, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels. Additionally, PCSK9 may reduce the risk of developing sciatica by lowering LDL-C and TC levels. In contrast, HMGCR appears to have no significant effect on IVDD, sciatica, or LBP development. Nonetheless, further research is needed to verify these preliminary results. MST1 warrants further exploration as a potential therapeutic target. It is necessary to do further research to validate these findings.\"},\n",

We conducted a comprehensive analysis that integrated genome-wide association studies (GWAS), expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL), and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data. Summary Data-Based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Bayesian colocalization analyses were employed to investigate causal relationships between gene expression and urolithiasis, while external validation and multivariable MR controlled for confounding factors. Seven genes were identified as significantly associated with urolithiasis, with LMAN2, NUCKS1, and L3MBTL3 highlighted as key contributors. LMAN2 was positively associated with urolithiasis risk (SMR b\\u2009=\\u20090.842, FDR\\u2009<\\u20090.05), with evidence that increased LMAN2 expression elevates stone formation likelihood, supported by findings from DNA methylation and protein level analyses. Conversely, NUCKS1 and L3MBTL3 exhibited protective effects, with NUCKS1 expression negatively associated with urolithiasis and supported by methylation at the cg12081870 site. Bayesian colocalization analysis showed strong shared genetic bases for NUCKS1 and L3MBTL3 with urolithiasis, with further multivariable MR confirming these associations were independent of BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and serum calcium levels. Genetic correlation analysis revealed significant positive genetic correlations between LMAN2 and urolithiasis (rg\\u2009=\\u20091.12, P\\u2009=\\u20098.11e-11), while NUCKS1 (rg\\u2009=\\u2009-\\xa00.60, P\\u2009=\\u20093.10e-03) and L3MBTL3 (rg\\u2009=\\u2009-\\xa00.38, P\\u2009=\\u20091.20e-03) showed strong negative correlations. These findings provide critical insights into the genetic basis of urolithiasis, identifying LMAN2, NUCKS1, and L3MBTL3 as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, offering a pathway toward personalized treatment strategies.'},\n",
